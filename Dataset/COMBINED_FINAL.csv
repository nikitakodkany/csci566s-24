I almost feel vindicated, as I was very much on the fence, and couldn't see how people here could say for sure it was 100% a good move. Interesting to hear him say how approximately 1/3rd of the gigafactory battery supply would/could be for other car companies. I was a bit shocked to learn here that he isn't a majority shareholder and that there isn't a special ownership class.  In other words, I was surprised to learn that he can \""easily\"" be fired.  I had always wrongly assumed he had more ownership and was therefore able to stick behind some unpopular stances such as opening patents, remaining unprofitable during growth, and generally focusing on his mission of sustainable transport over the common shareholder goal of maximizing profits.

Just how many balls do you expect one man to juggle?  You started off with false information. &gt;It's illegal to research cloning  In fact it's not illegal to research cloning, it's just illegal to create a human clone in most countries, and other countries even restrict it further by making it illegal to clone stem cells and other human tissue. But take your work to another country and you can go ahead and experiment.  The people of many countries have what I'll call the \""Ick Factor\"" when it comes to cloning people, but they happily condone cloning plants without a thought, and we have successfully cloned animals without much backlash. If your dog should up and die, there are companies that will create you an identical looking dog to replace it.  I guess my big question to you is, why bother cloning people?  In my short lifetime over **4 BILLION** people have been added to the population. Obviously we are very prolific breeders as a species, and we might just fuck our way to oblivion if we don't slow down.  Why introduce another way to make more of what we already have an abundance of? Very interesting idea i don't think cloning is needed for space colonization. it will probably play a role for individuals who purposely want to send specific genetic copies of themselves, loved ones, or famous people to another planet. but cloning would be an unnecessary step in colonization. sending a sperm and egg bank for the purpose of IVF would be better than clones for starting a new population. it will ensure a continual source of diverse genes and combination of gametes. whereas with clones, they would probably be selected by paying customers and a ship full of cloned embryos selected on personal preferences might not start off genetically diverse. also, you can't combine the clones until they are fully grown or at least reach a gestational age when their gametes can be harvested, which is an added surgical risk. if the clones die, their genetics could be lost, while a sperm/egg bank would still have reserves. it was my impression that the sciences and medical field also have lots of experience with IVF, but not as much with cloning. and that cloning is much more technically difficult and uses up more gametes in failed attempts.  either way, clones or IVF babies need surrogate mothers or artificial wombs. they also need some kind of infrastructure to support their development. i imagine that either robots or adult humans would have to create a self sufficient base before they can think about adding more mouths to feed. if they can't get more colonists, they will probably have to resort to IVF with the sperm/egg bank to enlarge the active gene pool, before they allow natural reproduction. or, they might allow couples to have 1 natural child but the rest to be surrogate children, at least for the first several generations. or, all IVF children might be artificially gestated. but i wonder what social consequences that would make. would they be as loved as natural children would be? would the other adults or children treat them the same way? very interesting to see what would happen, although it probably wouldn't happen in our lifetimes. if the spacex dream comes true, there will probably be plenty of colonists for intrasystem locations. artificial reproduction would probably be more for livestock, crops, and terraforming.   my guess is that artificial reproduction in humans would be more relevant for interstellar colonization. generation ships would require a huge mass penalty. i also imagine that the target planet would have to be very earth-like or the first colonists would never be self-sufficient. the first exploratory probes send before even considering colonization would have to be very thorough, and mission control would have to keep track of the probe missions for generations when some governments or countries don't even last that long, much less legislative approval or funding. Easily the stupidest post I've ever seen on reddit.",9,,0

The people of many countries have what I'll call the \""Ick Factor\"" when it comes to cloning people, but they happily condone cloning plants without a thought, and we have successfully cloned animals without much backlash. If your dog should up and die, there are companies that will create you an identical looking dog to replace it.  I guess my big question to you is, why bother cloning people?  In my short lifetime over **4 BILLION** people have been added to the population. Obviously we are very prolific breeders as a species, and we might just fuck our way to oblivion if we don't slow down.  Why introduce another way to make more of what we already have an abundance of? Very interesting idea i don't think cloning is needed for space colonization. it will probably play a role for individuals who purposely want to send specific genetic copies of themselves, loved ones, or famous people to another planet. but cloning would be an unnecessary step in colonization. sending a sperm and egg bank for the purpose of IVF would be better than clones for starting a new population. it will ensure a continual source of diverse genes and combination of gametes. whereas with clones, they would probably be selected by paying customers and a ship full of cloned embryos selected on personal preferences might not start off genetically diverse. also, you can't combine the clones until they are fully grown or at least reach a gestational age when their gametes can be harvested, which is an added surgical risk. if the clones die, their genetics could be lost, while a sperm/egg bank would still have reserves. it was my impression that the sciences and medical field also have lots of experience with IVF, but not as much with cloning. and that cloning is much more technically difficult and uses up more gametes in failed attempts.  either way, clones or IVF babies need surrogate mothers or artificial wombs. they also need some kind of infrastructure to support their development. i imagine that either robots or adult humans would have to create a self sufficient base before they can think about adding more mouths to feed. if they can't get more colonists, they will probably have to resort to IVF with the sperm/egg bank to enlarge the active gene pool, before they allow natural reproduction. or, they might allow couples to have 1 natural child but the rest to be surrogate children, at least for the first several generations. or, all IVF children might be artificially gestated. but i wonder what social consequences that would make. would they be as loved as natural children would be? would the other adults or children treat them the same way? very interesting to see what would happen, although it probably wouldn't happen in our lifetimes. if the spacex dream comes true, there will probably be plenty of colonists for intrasystem locations. artificial reproduction would probably be more for livestock, crops, and terraforming.   my guess is that artificial reproduction in humans would be more relevant for interstellar colonization. generation ships would require a huge mass penalty. i also imagine that the target planet would have to be very earth-like or the first colonists would never be self-sufficient. the first exploratory probes send before even considering colonization would have to be very thorough, and mission control would have to keep track of the probe missions for generations when some governments or countries don't even last that long, much less legislative approval or funding. Easily the stupidest post I've ever seen on reddit.",9,,0

Absolutely worthwhile but I do recommend seeing it during offpeak times as many people talked through the complex parts. I'M SOLD! My personal view on this movie was that it was great, however I really liked the book a lot more.  The book was amazing and thats coming from a person who doesn't read very often, the details in the book made it a lot more entertaining, however its just impossible to have that level of detail in a 2 and a half hour movie so I can't complain. Also, I wish they would have thrown in a lot more of the funny parts from the book, but in order for that to have happened they would have to have made it Rated R. They had to make compromises which is to be expected. Without a doubt, I would most definitely recommend the movie. I just went and saw it based on Elon's suggestion and I really enjoyed it. If you have the time then I definitely recommend that you go see it. I had nothing to do today. I literally saw that Tweet, then got in my car and drove to the theater. Amazing movie.",19,,0

Does he do the Elon equivalent of browsing reddit for 20 minutes?",19.0,29.0,"[deleted] I don't want to be that guy that assumes things, but just in case you're thinking of copying his lifestyle, only 1% of people can get away with having less than 7 hours sleep every day. In Ashlee Vance's book it says he regularly googles Tesla and SpaceX to see whats being said. He tweets a lot about articles which sort of proves this. He also reads blogs such as \""bad astronomy\"" and \""wait but why\"" and looks at \""xkcd\"". As has been said he apparently plays videogames. Again the book mentions in spacex they would have an hour set aside everyday where the entire factory would play together. I doubt this still happens. So yes, I'd say he does have some time in his days where he's not working purely to advance the company. Everyone needs some relaxation. Geniuses take breaks of course, in fact it's often the reason for their genius. Taking breaks allows your brain to process complex information and solve it in the background. Thomas Edison used to hold steel ball bearings in his hand and fall asleep in a chair, when he fell asleep they would drop and hit a metal saucer waking him up. This quickly put him into the diffuse mode of the default mode network.   So in short, Elon probably discovers most when he is talking with friends or taking a walk or googling Tesla/SpaceX, after large focused sessions of time and during his breaks discovers what to do. You enter this alternate state when doing misc things that require a little less focus, some weak activities are gaming, watching movies, browsing Reddit. Some strong activities include certain forms of meditation, dancing, talking with people (using social working memory), taking a walk, etc. I'm certain that Elon does more of the latter than the former and thus thinks more creatively during his breaks.

On his reddit AMA someone asked him what routine gave him the biggest productivity boost and he said, \""taking showers\"".

Can't have that!  The fact that he is being attacked so aggressively for criticizing the media proves his point. Oh am I ever GLAD Elon is going to do something about the real problem of the FAKE media that runs around rampant! It's not just that people write for advertisements, it's that they write based on \""pay to play \""for people. Look, I research websites. I find many of them are SET UP to destroy people or PUMP them UP as they see fit. It is a controlling factor in media. One such time I tracked 4 dozen sites, associated with ONE individual wanting to promote himself in POSITIVE light, when in FACT he is nothing more than the worst individual I have ever come across.   I don't think that Elon is wrong in wanting to crack down on credibility of media, but I wonder how it will work with all the FAKE names used to create these fake media presentations to smack\\-down someone or to lift them up. The only way I can find to reveal the truth in these media manipulations is to actually make websites NO LONGER PRIVATE. Names must be associated with a website so that they may be traced. That means changing an industry policy. Not an easy task to perform when it is a worldwide policy needing changed. Yet, this WOULD really help tho when things like Cambridge Analytical and artificial news is created to sway a public into voting around the world. journalists coming after elon for suggesting we keep journalists accountable... shocking /s \""here's how that's connected to Russia\"" Honestly I think Elon could have played this better, but he's right. The media have been super unfair to him. They cover every tiny little thing that goes wrong with any electric car, or self driving car, especially from Tesla. I mean, he knew that was going to happen going up against one of the oldest monied industries on the planet, but I can see how it would get to him after a while. I get sick of the Elon hating in the media too.      I hope he finances this project but doesn't attempt to run it. I think its actually a great idea! But I think someone like Glen Greenwald would be a much better face of it than Elon. Musk is mainly mad about unfair media coverage of Tesla but now he’s starting to criticize the media more broadly. His main issue with the media is they think they are infallible. If the media criticizes a person and that person defends himself the media will say he’s just like Trump and hates the media. It’s a no win situation and Musk is sick of it. Can we all be honest and just say the MSM is absolute corrupt garbage? If I was a useless journalist/news reporter that was told all of the sudden I have to report the truth with no bias twist to give my self a name... ya I would be upset too BUT! That’s why Elon is THE MAN! Props to him! I fully support his idea to peer off faulty journalism. Don't even try messing with the press, even if they journalist have no moral. That seems to be the message here. Remember what they did to Peter Thiel? As much as I agree with the Journalism\\-check system that Elon is proposing, can someone explain how he will avoid this voting system being ~~overused~~  abused by extremely biased users? I mean like r/politics and r/The_Donald bias levels. How will some people remember to keep fair? Isn't this the reason why the Electoral College exists? because direct democracy is actually dangerous \\(see Tyranny of the Majority\\)? Joking or not, this has hurt his image.  The parallels to trumps fake news claims when press stories don't go his way... Reeks of desperation.  Instead of fixing his shit... He chooses the lower road of blaming others for his shortcomings. Something similar happened in 2014 with a call for some better ethical standard in gaming press, but that was a stalemate.  The press labeled the group calling for ethics as woman hating trans-phobes while quietly implementing the disclosures the group had asked for.",254,"There is good reason for being protective of the media these days so I can see why so many are \""butthurt\"" but nothing he has said could be considered detrimental to any reputable organization. Let's see what he comes up with and go from there. The journalist  job is already jeopardized by Internet, it will be much more jeopardized by future efficient AIs.   And yesterday, they learned that Elon Musk is going to create a way to allow people to check their works etc...   His idea could great or it could be the beginning of an information controled by the mass which is not good for me. I hope Elon is right and that will be great! If '''''journalists'''''' are upset that must mean he is doing something right. Does it strike anyone else as odd they all seem to have the same patronising tone?   I believe Journalists who're so bathed in immaturity and emotion have a hard time of actually writing objectively.   These emotionally driven journalists are the reason we need to have a credibility system in place. Not to be confused with passionate journalists, I'm strictly talking about the one's who can't calmly and rationally think about the issue's they're being paid to write about. Probably somehow related to Jeff Bezos telling his WaPoo flunkies to trash SpaceX. Maybe he should step down from Tesla because it seems like he's too busy starting side projects and having flame wars on Twitter than actually fixing Tesla's problems hahaha eat shit you fuckin dorks I’m sure Elon won’t be building any of the site himself. He will do like you said. He purchased the website and now he will hire someone to build it for him, and then it should self govern/regulate itself if done correctly.",18

Getting rid of personal belongings, about to be father to another child, dealing with the pandemc most likely postponing his plans by months maybe years. It's very likely that he's upset and not being in control, especially being someone as powerful as him, must be frightening.  Edit: spelling mistake Best wishes for the birth!!! As entertaining as this all is, I seriously hope he seeks some help regarding his mental health, for his own good. [deleted] Ya, that part was making me wonder if he was hacked or potentially drugged. I think the stress of being about to have a baby during all this has to be messing with him.

The Denmark study showed the under-70 IFR is [0.08%](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20075291v1) and the Italy under-60 IFR is [at 0.05%.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.20070912v1) The newly revised Santa Clara/Stanford study shows all-age IFR is [0.17%](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v2).  Unlike the first estimate of a 3.4% fatality rate back in February, we no longer need to rely on early partial data from a single city. We now have many different experiments done by different teams of scientists, using different populations around the world and different methodologies. While science is not done by consensus, the results of the over 40 separate studies we have as of yesterday, indicate a median IFR of 0.2%. I don't think we can call this definitive yet but it does significantly narrow the possible range of IFR toward the lower end. Two months ago we feared the fatality rate was 3.4%. Even four weeks ago there were a lot of people who still feared IFR might be as much as 1%. Today, we can be increasingly confident that IFR is almost certainly under 0.5% (an upper-bound set by NY, one of the hardest hit), and likely between \\~0.1% and \\~0.3% with the vast majority of fatalities focused on 70+ year-olds already in failing health, which is where we should focus all our efforts and resources instead of massive [lockdowns of everyone.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-29/coronavirus-lockdown-critics-may-have-some-valid-points)  These scientific breakthroughs also show that CV19 is not nearly as deadly as we thought. Tens of millions of people have already been infected, never even felt sick and are now immune, probably for three to five years.These discoveries led [Tom Jefferson, an epidemiologist](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1375) with the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford to say  &gt;“There can be little doubt that covid-19 may be far more widely distributed than some may believe... and is unlikely at this point to slow or halt viral circulation as the genie is out of the bottle.  Scientists around the world have succeeded in bringing us the knowledge needed to save more lives and beat CV19 faster. Recent antibody tests show that 25% of NYC is already infected. The unprecedented worldwide lockdown was a heroic effort but has barely slowed our enemy's advance. It's time to change tactics from trying to hide from CV19 and instead commit to directly shielding the elderly and at-risk from death as [Sweden is successfully doing ](https://voxeu.org/article/underpinnings-sweden-s-permissive-covid-regime)and this [new study supports.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079913v1)  The only questions that remain are whether the public will have the wisdom to understand that the science has changed and if our leaders will find the courage to act on it.  We need to ask ourselves, what is the purpose of continuing lockdowns now? They already did their job by preventing hospitals being overwhelmed. In fact, except in NYC for a few days, nowhere in the U.S. even got close. Now that the surge has passed, there is no further benefit in continuing lockdowns. Remember, lockdowns don't \""save\"" anyone. They're merely a temporary \""Pause\"" button. Delaying isn't \""saving\"" anyone, it's just building a bigger backlog of postponed infections while slowing our progress toward the immunity that *will*save lives.  &amp;#x200B;  1/2",8

I feel like due to Covid, Elon is giving a lot of attention to randoms. It's all so stupid, though. These people that are attempting to cancel others sometimes with the flimsiest of evidence. I'm more than willing to listen to what Elon did wrong here but all I've heard or seen so far is a picture of him standing beside her and then a bunch of baseless (so far) accusations. A lot of this just smacks of a witch hunt.   Most anyone that is successful (certainly to the level of Elon Musk) is going to have detractors. They seem to come out of the woodwork as opportunity presents itself with accusations containing no evidence and people just eat this stuff up.

They will accept it as reality and condemn him without evidence. What happened So let me get this straight...

Also isn’t cancel culture basically harassment? What Elon said was true but I don’t think it can be applied to himself I mean, you can want to Cancel Cancel Culture because it's harassment as well. Can't you? Those social media slogans are annoying as fuck ???  1) reporting people does not mean cancelling them  2) He wanted to cancel the cancel culture in both pics, first in general and then to defend himself.  what a dumb tweet Someone explain me whats matter?

So cringe! It's a bait.

This is a satire account [removed] She should stop making wutang references and go pump some mumble rap that suits her iq better Well in Spanish a billion means (1.000.000 millions) What you call billions we call ( a thousand million) Originally billion, trillion were exponential systems. So a billion was a million million and trillion was a billion billion [removed] LOL I'am from Poland and for me it's correct cause one billion is 10¹² not like in US 10⁹. I didn't know that until now. go on 1 million seconds is abt 11 days, 1 billion seconds is abt 31 years Here's a more interesting fun fact: the $24 trillion added to the US national debt in the past 40 years would be enough money to buy homes for over 100 million families at the current average home price of ~$227k. Check that math and then ponder how far off course we are. Mighty Humanist She is technically correct if you use long form But if you use long form Elon has 70 milliard rather than 70 billion Or finances, he does not have $70 billion in his bank. 70k Do mind that 'billion' is not used the same in some other countries.The Dutch say 'milliard' instead of 'billion', whereas 'billion' would mean 1.000.000.000.000  Million, Milliard, Billion, Billiard, Trillion, Trilliard, Quadrillion, etc... is the order of \\*1000 increments in Dutch.

I just realized this account is satire... frick I honestly didn’t realize math was not the same around the world... that’s fucked up, what’s up?! whats down? fuck me... is it easier to become a billionaire than I thought?! If Elon musk net worth is really 70 billion, he could give 70 million people 70 dollars   Idk if this is actually accurate, just for a joke I wonder who the richest person in the world is in liquid cash, cos most billionaires are that rich from owned assets, not their wallet. Apparently he has 70 trillion dollars. God emperor confirmed. Im the worst person when it comes to math, Isnt it 1mil to 70 people [removed] Net worth ≠ money in the bank Nice save [removed] Let's pretend the numbers there work and let's pretend that net worth is the same thing as cash in the bank.... how does he choose which 70 million to give it to....because that is only just over 20% of the population of the United States. So, if only 1 out of every 5 gets it, how does he decide who? even if he COULD do that, why in tf would ever he do that? everrr  he didnt work that hard just to give money to ungrateful little jerks Except .. he doesn't have 70 billion in the bank - who has all their net worth in their bank account if billion means trillion then yeah The profilepicture is a stock image lol [removed] Some fun fact I read on some sub I didn't remeber: You, with maybe 1000€ acoount balance, are close to being a millionaire than Elon, Bezos etc 70 million X 1 = 70 billion.   Yup math checks out Tsla [removed] This is why there should be some sort of competency test or licence required before you’re allowed to post on social media. [deleted] Their is 37 trillion USD in the world. If that was spread throughout the world everyone would have only have about $4800 Even if numbers worked like that, wealth still doesn't work like that.  There's a reason why Musk getting a 2 billion dollar pay out from TSLA is big news. It's because it is very uncommon for people with large amounts of wealth to have even a billion dollars in liquid cash.",1045,"🤣 she can’t do math. If he has $70B then he could give two trains, one leaving Chicago, the other leaving Detroit, a chance to earn a prime number in euros at the same time when they meet. Unless they’re in the same track. Then they’d hit each other. So yeah. Better check your math before the trains wreck. I think... maybe it was pi #tezzzelthedrizzel Thats not how much he has in the bank  Idk why im saying this im guessing yall know this Wtf man.... Aside from the obvious, why don't these people get that they don't have that money in the bank? They can't just fucking go to the bank and cash out 70 million, it's called assets, and you probably have thousands of dollars as well, yet you call yourself broke because there's only 500 left for the rest of the month.  And it's been said before, but why the fuck should he just gift away what he worked for, if nobody else is doing the same? Communism can work, if everyone does what he can and wants to contribute, and there's no need to fight over stuff because there's enough for everyone, but as long as people don't want to contribute to society and only work a lame as job they don't like because it was the easiest way to get money, and as long as people are wasteful with resources and not willing to share stuff they don't need (not actually sharing stuff, but the mindset that your TV in the basement has never ever been used since you decided it would be a cool idea for garden parties, yet you never even think about getting rid of it because \""it's yours\""), and as long as we don't have streamlined processes for a lot of labor that nobody should do (mass producing stuff that isn't in any way fulfilling to the worker, which should be done by robots), that just isn't possible, so people like Elon need to work with the current system, get their assets, and then use them for good, like for science and stuff. If he were to give everyone 1k, then everyone would buy useless shit with that, and things like EV evolution and space exploration would take a big loss of funding.  And I know it's a parody account, but so many people say that stuff for real... Account may be satire, but this is how well communists think out their logic Well her could give 1 mill to all of us on his reddet thread lol That may not be how numbers work but that's how central banking works. But on the real, can i have a million dollars Elon? Please? How many emeralds could he give everyone ? r/technicallythetruth Maybe ist not a Problem of math. It could be a Problem of languages. Im German 1 Billion is not 1.000 million. Its 1.000.000 million. So she would be right. I mean... she's right. He COULD give a million to to each one of those people. Oh wow Elon's really becoming the twitter dipshits' poster boy for the 1%. Watch out Bezos, our boy's coming for the top spot! Well she’s not wrong, it just wouldn’t use all his money haha She is right tho, you muricans don't have your big numbers right. Like that nonsense you use as metric system. All part of your American exceptionalism I guess, or maybe just stupidity as the comment section demonstrates.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion?wprov=sfla1  Edit 1: For the the rest of the countries other than France, England and USA. Your billion (1x10^9) is not even close to our Billion. (1x10^12). For our understanding of billions Elon is not even a billionaire. He has a net worth of: Seventy thousand millions, meaning that if liquidated he could give a million dollars to only 70 thousand people. He would need one million dollars, one million times, to have a billion, from our perspective. I actually don’t get the reasoning on why the mathematics of this is wrong, while I know it’s wrong, I don’t see why it is wrong instinctively.",14

Man Elon is a fucking legend ‘..in case Earth gets hit by a meteor’  Lol, don’t worry, humans will find a way to fuck the planet up way before that happens He’s said before his inspiration for his companies and specifically Mars colonization is that he simply wants to be hopeful about the future. He didn’t want to think about the future as sad or depressing, and he figured sparking innovation through SpaceX, Tesla, Boring Company, Neuralink are ways to come up with solutions for problems we are currently facing/will face as a species that will allow for that to happen. He researched when NASA had plans for missions to go to Mars and when he realized they didn’t have one, he decided to take it upon himself to change that and eventually have society aspire to be a multi-planetary species.

Original tweet was deleted, does anyone know what the person said? I assume it was some remark about him having too much money. There was a lot of uneducated comments like that recently. E in the chatt boizzzz He is truly great Finally the right person is amassing huge amounts of wealth. Musky isn't all bad but this definitely reads like propaganda. We are right to question his attitude on extreme personal wealth. Take your nobel prize already elon I am wondering. Don't you guys think he could do more for keeping this planet alive? There are certain things he could do with his following that could have a massive impact. But he chooses(I think) not to do this. Don't get me wrong. I also admire Elon Musk for what he has accomplished. But the deification makes me think this sub has no room for constructive criticism Remember he wanted to reopen the tesla factories despite the covid pandemic? Yeah he so cares about all of us... Now that's called real 'Vision'. Imagine if the leaders of this planet would just focus on space migration instead of using so much money on military expenses. Problem is if Mars gets hit by a meteor 😅 Wouldn’t it suck if he got all of that done, and then Mars was the one that got hit by the meteor?

I've said this for years. Yes, Elon Musk is weird. He can be a massive dick. He clearly has some sort of messiah complex. But....

I applaud this, but why not donate to charity? Or something equivalent - build philanthropic foundations or similar  Don't get me wrong, I understand he **is** a philanthrope, and works for betterment of mankind but still, a lot of good-hearted organizations could use some money. Yeah, overworking your employees and banning unions is forgiven because he's funding a pie-in-the-sky PR stunt. I wish he would instead work on mind downloading so we could all live indefinitely.

Cyanobacteria Farming  I often imagine an indoor farming system I call \""milk bag farming\"" based off the plastic milk bags we used to get milk in on the east coast of Canada. Basically these plastic bags would be made from biopolymers synthesized from the culture you're growing. You would just hook them up a hydroponics system, grow photosynthesizing cyanobacteria in greenhouses, and supply them with water and fertilizer. Once the bag fills, disconnect it from the hydroponics system like a plump fruit and reattach a new one, already seeded with its own sample of cyanobacteria. Then you just toss the whole bag into a chemical solution where it gets broken down into more substrates for polymers. Both the bacteria and the bag, too, since they're made of the same stuff. A continuously renewable loop.  You could even use transgenic cyanobacteria that overproduce the particular compounds you want, and have different strains for different polymers, or produce biofuel, or just bake it in a coke oven and compress the leftover graphite into bricks and build a 200 billion metric ton pyramid from them. Which is about as much you would actually have to produce to meaningfully displace the amount anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. (remember graphite is just the carbon without the oxygen) And would be thousands of times larger than the actual pyramids. Or perhaps we could make thousands of regular sized pyramids. Its actually an extremely daunting volume of CO2 when you do the math. If you were to convert it back into oil again, you would need a entire great lake just to store it. Elon is on donation spending spree mood rn [removed] [removed] the replys on twitter are so toxic We already have carbon capture tech, just cant do it at scale and with super speed. This is not nuclear fusion, so yeah, its gonna happen soon. But the thing is, who will pay to deploy and maintain Carbon Capture Farm (CCF)? Government? Because the private sector have nothing to gain, you cant sell anything from CCF, yet. I say we give everyone CO2 bug nets and have a mandatory hour each day where you go outside and try to capture some CO2 Have they tried not cutting down forest? This is cool, but carbon capture is unlikely to be solved until someone invents a method that is more-efficient-per-acre than growing trees, *and* actually profitable instead of costly.

Usually when doing research you wait until step 1 is successful before testing step 2 because there is no value in step 2 even if it passes if step 1 didn't.  Warp speed said do all the steps at once for every possible solution.  So say they started with 50 possible solutions each requiring 10 steps to validate.  You start at 50, do step one for all 50, then step 2 for the 20 that pass then step three for the 10 that pass that and so on.  SO total you took say 100 steps to a solution.  Warp speed said fuck it, do all 500 steps at the same time we don't care what it costs.  And got a solution fast for 5 times the cost.  It isn't less safe just much more expensive. after saying it will be gone in a month? Then you should definitely get one!! Finally Elon doing some damage control.

The purchaser can request to distribute the donation as a spread over 1, 2 or all equally. The coins are purchased and auto to the selected org. and can be cashed by the (no profit organisation). Value of the minted coin donation is tied to the value of a stable coin running on the Cardano blockchain.   Client can choose to donate additional funds at any time.

That means they’re still interested in crypto.  Then look at this [Congressional Research Service report](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45863).  A few relevant excerpts:  1.\t“Fewer studies have examined power requirements for other cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency platform in both currency in circulation and transactions processed), although those studies have found comparatively lower power requirements than for Bitcoin.” 2.\t“One study on projections of Bitcoin growth considered the potential effects on global CO2 emissions should Bitcoin eventually replace other cashless transactions. The study found that the associated energy consumption of Bitcoin usage could potentially produce enough CO2 emissions to lead to a 2 degree C increase in global mean average within 30 years. These projections assume that the global portfolio of fuel types (and subsequent CO2 emissions) used to generate electricity remains fixed according to portfolio profiles from 2014 and does not consider that, in many cases, Bitcoin is often mined in areas with plentiful and affordable renewable energy.”  Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.

No wonder US population is among the first to get hit. Also see China - no 1/2 child policy anymore - same problem. Europe - ditto, hence entire \""welcome Syrian refugees\"" cunning plan.     Now if it is actually the large problem for humanity and civilization as a whole is not obvious. The way the pension funding is structured today it looks like it is, but we can change that with UBI in most affected (highest income) countries - politic who will do that will probably not be re-elected, but civilization most definitely will be just fine.       People motivations to have more children might change too. All it takes is a threat of lifting a ban of human cloning...

Haters will say you're still just paying less than 6% of your wealth, and giving away that much money wisely is a huge distraction. The only way this makes sense is if it shames or inspires many billionaires who aren't contributing positively to do the same. Good luck with that.  But you could work on a great pedal-assisted autonomous electric bike that the median household in India (135000 rupees per capita * 4.4 people per household * 20% = $1600) could afford. If he sells his stock and pays 53% tax on it and had billions in the bank then people will say he needs to pay a wealth tax.  This isn't about what's fair.  It's that people who don't like Musk and his lack of political conformity want him to be knocked down a peg via the government stealing his money. Would the money paid in taxes to the government be spent in an efficient manner? I have little faith it would.  To be clear, I realize that’s true regardless if Elon sells any stock. It’s the one company having some of the largest impact in the world and now it’ll be a rounding error in the tax budget. Please don’t sell to pay taxes. Governments just give them to other corporations. Please use your wealth to actually help the people somehow. Food for those in the world starving. Clean water to those in need. You have great power and respect. People will do the footwork for great things that your wealth can provide. Micro loans to other small business too. Also please can we get the cyber truck in Canada soon! (sorry, had to throw one in for me) Hell no, dont let them take your hard earned money, you do more for the world with one company than we could achieve with 100% of your wealth wtf Elon, do you really want to let twitter make your decisions for you? I hope he has a good plan with it. He isn't going to ever stop the socialists from trying to take his money and use it to pay themselves admin fees as they dribble crumbs into us poor peoples mouths while they tell us how bad we are at life and crippling our ability to help ourselves out. If he goes through and liquidated 10% of his holdings. That equates to 3% of the company which would put that at ~$30B right now. Obviously he won’t be able to sell them all without the price tanking drastically, so let’s assume he only gets $10B. Pays $5.3B to government in taxes, keeps $4.7B.  Would this be the greatest amount of liquid USD ever held by an individual? Has to be close I’d imagine… Elon is incredibly gifted.  He should be making his own decision with counsel from his advisors. This will just empower the ridiculous mob of people calling for this BS.  Why, Elon? Why? Why pay the government, when you can actually help with world starvation and have it as a tax write off Wouldn’t that cause a price crash and perfect opportunity to buy in? Musk coming in with another 4d chess move here. He wants to sell some tesla to fund the Mars mission anyway but doing so would crash the stock/ worry everyone. This way he gets to cash out some just after a nice run up to a pretty high valuation and satisfy the mob on taxes, starting his transition to full time on spacex. He knows exactly what he is doing.. turning a problem into an opportunity. The dude is trying to help the planet. He should be exempt from tax. No!

There's no income. The \""wrath\"" these websites report is his stock market assets.   His stock value assets isn't income, especially when he isn't selling/sold them.   He *could* take a loan against the value of the stock as collateral, but the loan money isn't taxable income.   Before you know it, this will become a rule......

There was a study on this recently that showed that people opposed taxes on all the wealthy because they sympathieze with one or a few of them.

Definitely need a phone booth in my office on tax payer expense I voted no - the left will vote yes overwhelmingly so. The opinion of the left has nothing to do with objective numbers, and everything to do with jealousy, envy, issues with other ppl doing well, only being as well off as they want you to be, it never ends. Communist type of thinking shrouded internally in the minds of liberals. I voted yes, fuck billionaires I voted no.  Elon Musk will allocate the money much better than the government.   Heck, the government spent trillions of dollars bombing little Arabs for decades (the innocent collateral damage is appalling).

From building up Zip2 with his brother(that's now paypal). He kept reinvesting his money and essentially kept betting on himself. He invested into Tesla t help with affordable zero emmision vehicles. \""Build a sports car. Use that money to build an affordable car. Use that money to build an even more affordable car. While doing the above, also provide zero-emission electric power generation options.”   He started \""The Boring Company\"" because he was stuck in awful california traffic and thought the best way to solve it was to bore tunnels under the ground.  He also runs the Neuralink. Musk has said the technology could be used for people with neural conditions and disorders, but has also predicted it could enable human \""symbiosis with artificial intelligence.\""  He also started SpaceX that he started because he feels that if something does happen to humanity we should have some of the population on Mars so that if a catastrophic event did happen humanity as we know it wouldnt be wiped out.  Pretty much everything he does is in an effort to better humanity or improve it. He is an extremely intelligent person and very fascinating to me personally. If you're at all interested i highly suggest reading about him and his life. Because he's actually doing something with drive, rather than sitting there with a thumb up his arse.   On a side note, it seems to me that there are more people out there obsessed with shitting on him.  You don't see the same hate for Jeff Besos who is out right abusing people and businesses or Mark Zuckerberg who's made more of a mess of society than any any other media outlet. Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, Boring Company, Starlink, PayPal, Mars.  Feel free to research any topic.  History hands us an odd prodigy through the ages.  He may not be as smart or certified as Albert Einstein was but make no mistake both are of equal greatness.    It takes not just education, but the world's greatest minds in order to achieve true change and innovation.  Money is the tool, not the motive.  This is why the rest of Earths global elites aren't exactly doing much. Have you been living under a rock for the past 10 years? self made., hands on leader, achieves what started out as impossible by most, cares about the future of humanity, and has a sense of humor.  if appreciating those things about _any_ person makes one a cultist or some other derogatory label, whose really got the problem? [removed] Not going to find anyone whose obsessed with him in this sub. We all just like to follow what he's doing because we find it interesting.  The only people I've come across that are obsessed with him are those that don't like him. He delibaretly threw himself in to two, protected, entrenched industries with the goal of disrupting them. The previous attempts by others at best, had stalled and usually they failed. He has succeeded.  That takes the strength of character few have. I can't help but admire that. He creates radical and new technological breakthroughs for society.  He is not doing these things for personal wealth.  With creating spaceX he has brought the cost down of going to space something around 90%, this alone will be one of the most important thing he has done for humanity.     Neurolink to help paraplegic's walk and use computers.  WIP but looks promising.  Tesla, not only what he has done with Tesla but he has shared some patents for the betterment of society.   He has Asperger's and does some pretty embarrassing things on an emotional side, I understand and give him a break here.  He created Starlink to give people in rural areas high speed internet.   He doesn't take joy rides to space (yet) like Bezos and Branson.  Thay can't even reach orbit which is much more difficult than skimming the atmosphere.  \\---CREATED---  Billions of dollars for not only people but for governments through taxes.

Tweets like this just show he is human and fallable. Seeing stuff like this makes me think we don’t have accurate data on global population. I don’t think there’s a population growth problem at 7 billion+ people.   Is that number not accurate? There’s only so much bio-mass available.  More people means less everything else.  The world will survive a human population collapse. We won’t survive one of the eco-sphere. I also don’t agree with the idea of population decline- and if anything I welcome it. We waste so much - there definitely needs to be a huge decline. I think we have the problem, but it’s not about Earth, rather than certain countries. For example, Japan and China have demographic problems as average couple produces less than 2 kids, so country will not be able to replace old generation with new.  But, there are communities where one woman produces many kids, quite overpopulating their country. I don’t know what fix we can do about it, countries can certainly make themselves easier to enter, however, “digesting”cultures quickly might be hard for some part. Serious question (not rhetorical): What's he talking about here?  \""... aren't enough people for earth\""?  There's over 7 billion people on Earth and plenty of them still war over prescious resources.  And even if the population *growth rate* is declining, the population itself is still increasing. No? Plot twist on Elon, He made a bet with one of his friends on a higher plane of existence, that if he managed to put that race of uncool monkeys from Heart on Mars, he wouldn't have to do the celestial dishes ever again. Calling my girlfriend to tell her Elon wants us to fuck [deleted] cause ppl can barely take care of themself, yet alone have a baby I don’t want kids. Then, I can’t afford Mars! When China lifts its child birth restrictions, you know there's no over population issue. The less people the better. People are assholes. Whoever is reading this post is not though lol. &gt;population growth falling  Hey y'all need to let us Indians in to your 1st world enclaves, we'll take care of the rest. So when we get to Mars is he just the King or what? Fit the U.S., until cost of living goes back to where a single worker can support a household having a large family is on the back burner. The problem with wanting people to reproduce is that, at least in the US, reproducing takes so much out of your paycheck. People have and will lose lots of money because having children is not affordable.  I feel like sure, eventually having a kid would be great, but I’d have to be living off of a high-end job making closer to 6 digits a year, which for most average people, is a dream and nothing more. These are what he linked to in further tweets https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53409521.amp https://www.npr.org/2021/05/05/993817146/u-s-birth-rate-fell-by-4-in-2020-hitting-another-record-low?s=09 I need more financial incentives. Isn’t Africa will add 4 times that of current population in coming years? he's absolutely right. in countries like Italy or Japan the situation is pretty dire. We definitely have population decline. We were never going to have enough people for mars. Trends need to reverse or we'll be headed for a serious decline. What's wrong?  Not enough capitalism slaves to keep the shelves stocked? Worried about a \""collapse\""...  LMFAO.  8 BILLION PEOPLE on the earth.. humans aren't going to disappear.   My theory is that with the recent massive employee shortages from Covid, is that it scares the fuck out of big cooperations that need us!  In the past, if a worker or two are sick and out of work, then the company will be just fine. They'll fire you, and replace you quickly. But when massive amounts are out, there is POWER in numbers.  Look at Delta Airlines.  This statement is scare tactics to hopefully prevent something like this ever happening again and then poor rich fucks having to think about how WE are the very ones keeping them on top. What if I want to goto Mars to clap alien cheeks? Yeah I'd consider kids if I could afford them.. I believe Thanos was right Elon is disgusting for this and ever since I’ve seen his comments about “falling population” which is completely untrue, I have lost complete respect for the man. Never really respected him much anyways, just another selfish billionaire trying to hide his actions behind a smokescreen of robinhood Elon’s a smart guy, but I feel like it might be wiser to listen to multiple experts over one great engineer So he would support higher min wage, better working conditions and stronger government support of middle and lower classes so that people dont feel compelled to put off marriage and kids more and more as they try to establish a relatively secure financial base? (No. No he would not) Makes me question if Elon is actually intelligent or not... *Rolls eyes* If we keep destroying Earth there won't be a way for us to make trips to Mars let alone make it sustainable. People often forget the elites want only 500 million people in the world. So many people don’t have a clue what is reality. They are used to being told what is true. Seriously, what's wrong with the human population shrinking. It would be better for the planet.   The only downside is that capitalism/pensions fall apart without young people.   Actually, one of the best things for civilization was the time after the plague, when the populations shrank and Prosperity happened. The population in the world is not low or something he is just talking about rich kids that can afford it because in many countries there is so many homeless kids or abusive kids which can't afford to go to Mars or most of the population that has many kids can't even afford they kids in Earth :\\ He's got a point...  at the current rate of people who just don't want to work, we need more people just to get a decent number of those who will be engaged and not looking to be taken care of. With the increase in automation, is it really a problem to have less people? [removed] I’ve read articles that new generation just doesn’t give a fuck to have kids. Most don’t even care to have sex. But we are already to many people for earth The Elon baby boom I think this is a good solution to many different problems I think he's less concerned about the number of people, and more concerned about younger workforce. Also by extention, the number of them that would go to Mars. Personally the planet c do with a few less people to start thinking of stability, over growth. Get abundance into every part of the world He mentioned this in one of his talks before COVID.. the one with Jack Ma. Someone is upset they won’t all be buying his cars, never mind the bullshit.   We have more than enough people on the planet.  We struggle to feed them, not because we don’t have enough food, but because food is produced for profit not hunger.   Now, produce some more kids, folks. Elon needs more taxpayers to subsidise his “adventures”. He must not included were I live.  Catholic community, 5-10 kids per family.  I’m not catholic, I have my 1.93 children at home. Ngl, I didn't want many kids, if any all at all, but now I want to have 7 kids with my gf and make them reach the stars To get his mars shot he needs a growing population that is fit. Is that why he help spread COVID?  COVID targets mostly the elderly, diabetics, renal patient, and cancer patients. A monster like Elon saw the math and found it perfect for his future. Overpopulated countries: Hold my Balls He should just keep making them. nobody else can afford them.. He wants to make sure there are enough people willing to go to Mars. just let the dude go to mars without interrupting him man He is right, isn't he No worries i with my army will take care of the population growth you continue on your Mars Mission One good nuclear war and we won't have to worry about global warming... Remember people being scared of overpopulation? When Elon says fuck, you fuck something I don't think that's gonna happen   after say a century    i think world population will get almost saturated As much as I usually support him, I don’t agree with this. Yes, it’s probably better for developed countries like the US to have a greater population for faster economic growth. But for poorer, developing countries, overpopulation only means there won’t enough resources for everyone. I may be very naive but why is population decline such an issue? Wouldn’t it be good to have fewer people on the planet, for the planet’s sake? There would be more room, more resources, less pollution, etc. I understand…THE ECONOMY…but who gives a fuck if other circumstances are better. #thanoswasright I’m starting to think this guy just doesn’t want to pay taxes and have more cheap labor so he can build his Mara colony and ditch us. He’s starting to be the problem Damn Elon says dumber shit every day How many kids you have with how many wives, again?? Louder for those in the back!!! No one wants kids in this godforsaken world... change it for the better rich man maybe people will want kids Nah, just be less xenophobic and loosen imigration laws, lower development countries have higher birth rate but lower quality of life, by doing this you can get the manpower required to manage low employment jobs. Just look at the European Union and Britain after brexit. What an idiot. Population increase will literally make *everything* worse except that one single imaginary project, having enough people to waste on trying to reach Mars. I’m sure Elon will need hundreds, if not thousands, of pioneer peons to die by failure so that he can arrive with confidence. He wants workers for his company and his future missions to Mars. I find it funny how it’s the rich always complaining that people aren’t having enough kids [removed] Honestly I don't blame people for not wanting to have kids,  the world sucks, the economy sucks, people suck. [removed] I wish I could just impregnate women on a whim and be able to afford it like Elon. What an absolute madlad, i mean, being so full of himself needs an Oscar. Maybe people will consider having children if climate change and poverty wasn’t catching up to them. Or maybe they don’t want kids, woah, what a revelation. More people on Earth is the very last thing we need. \""Population collapse\"" is just a form of transition were total pop goes down. It ONLY hurts capitalism, not people (good thing in the long run). Less people, less pressure for ressources, less wars.  It would actually take a REAL population collapse for humanity to be in danger (like one derived from.. A war). A slight drop in pop due to aging is just going to show how younger people gets exploited (while not chosing their future (gerontocracies hello)), which is even better. Decades of pumping Malthus into peoples heads. Chickens coming home to roost. Yes, because data from one year during a pandemic definitely implies a future trend for years to come. The earth is just at capacity. If mars were terraformed there would no doubt be a massive population boom. Mars. Lmao… Maybe he meant quality population collapse... [removed] Shrinking government will cause a surge in patriarchy style living causing a higher birth rate. Maybe people aren’t procreating because they’re fucking broke and the earth is being destroyed. Bruh, quit makin charge stations and switch to breeding stations. I’m sure it would be hard, but that’s the business. Lol it’s not like we’re the most invasive overpopulated species on the planet [removed] [removed] The world doesn’t need more people.  I think that’s what he’s not understanding here.  The more people we add the more resources it takes to support those people and our existence is more threatened by lack of vital resources in time.  Wether that be fresh water, clean air, food or anything else humans need to continue living.  If one of these goes then real collapse of the human population is on the horizon. I feel like lower population would=less environmental impact and more affordable housing though... I don’t think planet colonization will ever relieve earths over population. Going to and colonizing another planet would be awesome, but how would you get even 5-10% of people off world. And why? Why? Because of robots, workforce decline is not an issue. Too bad I'll never make enough in this economy to have a child even if I wanted to lol [removed] Elon the type of person that only cares about quantity and not quality.

The earth is over populated, what is he talking about... [deleted] If there aren't enough people to destroy Earth we won't need to go to Mars.  Just like, if not enough people get Covid we won't need to get vaccinated. Considering how much it costs to not only have, but care for children it’s easy for him to say considering all the money he has. The majority of the population (speaking the U.S) can barely even afford to take care of themselves let alone bring another human being into this world. The country itself and the planet seem to be in a steep decline and it only appears to be getting worse. You say population growth is down but do you mean every ethnicity or just one particular ethnicity?

I volunteer to get as many women pregnant as possible. I am tall, dark, and handsome, and fairly stupid. So you have some chance of a normal person. I think. A billion+ humans is definitely enough lol can't even afford to live anyways what ya expect? I thought we were overpopulated So he needs more slaves to his machine? I in general support Musk but not in this lmao. Treat your workers better then talk, it’s not all about what you want. How does the increased efficiency and automation play into this? Can we automate our way out of a lot of the population decline problems and make the earth more sustainable? March 6, 2020  As worldwide Covid-19 cases topped 100,000 and deaths exceeded 3,000, Musk tweeted, “the coronavirus panic is dumb.” Send the old to mars Just because that guy is rich enough for 6 kids. Doesn't mean the rest of us should be.  Also when his kids are grown it'll be a real life HBO's Succession. That's cause  radical feminism is poisoning the well So I have some thoughts.tl;dr he has a flawed take and doesnt know about this.    He seems rather anxious about this today. I guess he read some stuff,as he also linked some articles. This is one thing I just cant agree with him on.   Elon is able to support as many kids as he wants with like minded partners,and haa 6 kids himself. Good for him. If he and the kids mothers are happy with it,thats great,however its a problem for him to go around telling the whole world,who doesnt have his money ans resources,that they all need to start popping them out.   A pandemic is raging,the medical system is overloaded and losing workers. There are labor shortages,honestly,it really is a poor idea for people to have kids now. Why would people want to?   Furthermore,he offers zero solutions. Just going oh no,the sky is falling. He seems to be kinda willfully ignoringthe issues. He shouls just say he doesnt know any good solutions. He offers nothing on how it will be solved. We get his goal is getting humans on Mars,but he's so focused on that,to the point of shutting other stuff out.   The other thing is,he isnt someone who will bear children. He has no idea and never will. Women bear kids,but a lot goes into carrying and birthing kids he just cannot ever understand. Its not easy,its risky,things can go wrong,etc. Not everyone can have kids or even wants to,though that seems no concern of his really. He thinks they should just do.it.   I dont want kids. The only way Id reproduce is by donating eggs lol. I dont plan to do that. I have no one to reproduce with,but I\""d be entertained by his attempt to find a fine male specimen worth reproducing with. Good luck. He's free to do that and pay me like 10 billion. I'll at least consider it then. Otherwise. Nope. Sorry,Elon. Not happening.   Other people might disagree. The comments are wild on the tweet,some even frightening and bordering on Handmaid's Tale-esque takes. TBH any time I see one of his tweets,I think what is he trying to pull this time? Thats scary 😟 Well let's see when the family court system completely castrates all fathers and men then there's no wonder why there's very few that actually want to have children anymore Thus, he really is a lunatic after all... He's worried about his future profits... I guess 7 billion is not enough for him... he needs more souls to suck up their assets and spirit ... Then maybe he should support vaccinations instead of being a complete tool Assuming he is true and the population will begin to fall soon, we have a very long time to go before the population gets down to worryingly low numbers. By which time we'll probably have all manner of new science to increase population if we wanted.  Even with no new science, there are plenty of levers we can pull to increase population growth: tax incentives, generous parental leave, free child care and schooling etc  If the population dipped down to say a couple of billion before stabilizing then that's not a bad thing! What a capitalistic piece of shit. Calm down Elon we need a currency first . Pick a currency for mars besides dogelon mars Calling my girlfriend &amp; her mom/sister/her best friend to come over we bouta make history Elon should start his own child assistant service then.
