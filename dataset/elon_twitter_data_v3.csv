Among the topics of discussion was Firmware 6.0, which introduces the ability for Model S owners to gain full control of the air suspension settings.   &gt; According to Musk, Version 6.0 is nearly complete and just weeks away from being released to the market. The firmware update will re-introduce the ability for the Model S to automatically lower at a given speed  a hotly debated topic after Firmware 5.8 saw the removal of the feature set which many believed it to be a proactive stance by the auto manufacturer to address the ongoing fire investigations by the NHTSA.   &gt; Firmware 6.0 will provide Model S owners the ability to manually set the transition height of the air suspension across a much wider range of speeds. Lowering and raising of the vehicle will be 100% configurable and no longer a guessing game on if and when the automatic suspension will engage.   &gt; Aside from the suspension controls, the Tesla Model S Firmware 6.0 will also introduce real-time traffic information thereby making navigation and driving time calculations much more precise.

I think everyone does.  But, they do employ a ton of people and that can't be overlooked. I already sent my complaint to Senator Patton, the author of the bill (and who has taken almost $50k in donations from the automobile dealer's lobby in campaign donations, so he's clearly in their pocket) to complain about his sponsorship of this bill.  I recommend you all do the same.  [Link here]( Given the state's hostility towards previous attempts to push out Tesla (a dismissed lawsuit and a thwarted sneaky attempt to slip a ban into another law), I have hope legislators won't be fooled by this law.   But the Ohio legislature is very much so Republican controlled, and always has been (Thank you gerrymandering), so if this becomes a partisan issue, Tesla doesn't stand a chance.",15,,0

They might also have clauses that make selling through shell companies directly illegal. If they don\'t, they\'ll write them. Because there are laws in place to prevent exactly that.  The dealer associations want independent dealers that do nothing but buy product from Tesla. Tesla wants a direct sales model like Apple. Having just taken a test drive, I think the Tesla model could do with some improving to be honest.   That said, we should be careful what we wish for soon. If you know what you're doing and have good timing, you can get a really good deal on a car from a dealership. The Tesla Model leaves no room for negotiation and no room for deals on leftover vehicles, at least not how it sits.   In theory, direct car sales sound awesome.

It is clearly a shell company to circumvent the law, and I don\'t think setting such a relationship is as easy as you think.  There is a concept in corporate law called ""piercing/lifting the corporate veil"".

It relies on the vehicle having air flow over the front radiator system: no air, and you only get passive radiative cooling, which is significantly less effective. In addition,  the low gravity would mean hot air/gasses would not rise. This would stop the freon cooling system from working properly, I suspect.  So you could probably drive, but you wouldn't be able to charge (no thermal management), and you couldn't go fast (or it would limit power rapidly to stay cool.)  The moon is also rather cold, or extremely hot. Current li-ion batteries prefer a rather tepid 10~45C operating range. No guarantee the car would work at -50C, for example; if it did, it would be very limited.   This is one of problems NASA had with laptops on the ISS. A normal air-cooled laptop relies on hot air rising through a heatsink to cool a processor; IBM redesigned the cooling system for a Thinkpad which did not rely on this effect and NASA used those. I like this idea :) It might work, but not as well as on earth. Without as much gravity, you wouldn't get as much traction, and with moon dust, I'm not sure how the grip would be on normal tires.  Heat management would be an issue, the system for managing heat in the battery would work, but it wouldn't be able to lose heat from the system as quickly. Within the battery, the heat would be consistent, but in the sunlight it would get too hot pretty quick. In the shade, it would probably be fine, aside from traction issues.  As far as I know, none of the systems require an atmosphere to work. The pressure differential may be an issue in some places, the fluid in the batteries might be at too high of a pressure and cause ruptures in the pack, same with the heat management system, and if any of the motor/transmission has oil in it, that will be at the same pressure as earth atmosphere.  Ultimately, you are going to have leaks, but the thing will have more power than any ICE car would on the moon. Moon dust would wear it out fairly quickly, wouldn't it? I believe the gear box has a small amount of oil in it for lubrication as well. I'm not familiar with them much, but it may be possible that said oil could leak out when exposed to a vacuum (moon has no atmosphere) and that could be a problem...  Or is the gearbox sealed so tight it'd withstand a vacuum? It wouldn't work mainly because of moon regolith (dirt). Moon regolith is basically finely ground glass. It would quickly cause any rotating parts to grind to a halt.",26,,0

That is never a good point.  Overall though I think it was well argued and the people downvoting are probably being petty. BUT! He doesn't mention something very important. 2020. The block buy is freaking lasting til 2020. Yeah SpaceX has had delays and yeah they don't have a ton under their belt. But does the author think that these will still be an issue in 2018?  If so, is that believe SO strong that it outweighs the possible savings?  75% chance that SpaceX will still be severely production limited or run into a string of failures in 4 years? STILL worth killing the block buy. ULA savings lost buy not block buying those two years are minor compared to the savings coming from switching to SpaceX or even not switching but using SpaceX to negotiate lower prices. &gt; My objection primarily comes down to the fact that although SpaceXs Falcon 9 has proven reliable thus far, the company has failed to launch them on any sort of regular basis. Im also a bit baffled that the company wants to add more launches to an already crowded manifest that keeps slipping to the right.  As much as I love SpaceX, that is a good point.  It doesn't mean that the lawsuit was a bad idea, but still, it is an area in which SpaceX is lacking.  Hopefully that'll change in the near future with the increase in launchpads. It's nice to see a dissenting opinion, and a lot of that actually made sense to me! Thanks for posting that edward1990. If this is the best rationale the ULA and Air Force can dream up against a SpaceX bid, then SpaceX is going to win this going away.  This author has made new criteria out of thin air, *""timely launches""* then assigned this criteria a higher level of importance that does the Air Force.  If the Air Force were concerned about SpaceX hitting exact deadlines, they would have made it a component of the certification process.  They did not.    Clearly for the Air Force, reliability is **the** primary concern.  Reliability is so much of a larger concern than ""timely launches"", that ""timely launches"" isn\'t even a requirement.    Regarding the Air Force\'s requirements, with this latest successful launch, SpaceX has now exceeded the Air Force\'s *actual* requirements by ~~25%~~ 1/3rd.  They\'ve produced 4 successful launches of F9\'s with the Air Force\'s desired configuration.  The minimum certification was 3 such launches.  He has one argument and uses a thousand words to expound on it.  It\'s too bad for him that the actual buyers don\'t share his concern.  It\'s not even worth reading. The last lawsuit like this one took 15 months. By the time this is resolved SpaceX might have expanded production enough to take on new customers.   If they wait until they've expanded production then file a lawsuit they might miss out on over a year lucrative air force launches. Contractually preventing competition in a marketplace is contrary to US economic principles. I don't see any benefit to awarding a bulk number of launches rather than individual launches. If it's done in bulk; 36 launches, then, for instance, if SpaceX is deemed 'reliable' half way through then it is still barred from launching for the airforce, which is silly.  If SpaceX is being barred from competing until they have a longer record of launches then why is it being done until the ULA has 36 launches? Surely it would be more reasonable to allow SpaceX to compete once SpaceX has a certain number of successful launches. But perhaps an agreement of this kind can not be made for some reason.   It seems like crony capitalism to me, but it could just be the decision of conservative procurements people who don't regard competition as being terribly important. Perhaps there is some great benefit to having a sole provider that I'm not aware of. I'd be happy to be disabused of my ignorance if someone would explain it. We need constructive criticism if we want spacex to keep making the amazing product they are. He has good points The lawsuit is more of a statement than anything &gt; It didnt help that Musk spent half the press conference yesterday discussing his companys attempt to recover the first stage of the Falcon 9 booster for reuse. Dont get me wrong; I think the effort is fantastic, and it shows a willingness to **innovate** too often lacking in the space field. I wish them all the success in the world in achieving the goal.  &gt; But, its also the least important thing when it comes to winning military launches. Even Musk admitted it would take years for customers to get comfortable putting a payload on a reused booster. **The military will take much, much longer to get comfortable with launching any of its spacecraft this way.**  First of all I would catgorise creating a fully reuseable quickly relaunchable rocket as far more then innovative. What I hear you saying is that if SpaceX wants to tinker around and create a better rocket then they should do that on the side. In your opinion, which maybe correct, the military would be happier to see the same vehicle pumped out a bunch of times and be successful. Which I guess makes some sense, but if they can do both things at once and still have a so far pretty reliable track record why stop them from at least competing? And if that happens to be one of the reasons they lose the bid process then so be it. I think the cost savings between these two companies at the very least should force the military to allow competition.  I'm sure some spelling is wrong or grammer but I think this gets across my opinion. Spacex (Musk) has made a very good move with this lawsuit, and the timing is just right. The light that this lawsuit will shine on this situation will stop a few people in the procurement division of the U.S. Air Force from having any more ability to favour ULA over Spacex going forward.  When the 36 launches were awarded to ULA (at what appeared at the time to be a significant discount to previous arrangements), Spacex had not yet met the criterion required to bid on the military launches. Offering 14 more launches, as part of the same package, to be put out to bid was an acknowledgement that Spacex would probably be in a position to bid on these contracts at some point in the future. This didn't appear unreasonable at the time and Spacex did not complain publicly. However, when it was announced that total number of launches in the package needed to be cut back, and all of the cutbacks came from launches that were to be bid on, it was clear that Spacex was getting the shaft and gave them the justification to launch the lawsuit.  Whether Spacex wins the lawsuit or not doesn't matter. The whole point is to shine a spotlight on the cronyism and corruption that goes on with a few people in the procurement division of the U.S. Air Force. This will certainly put an end to that going forward.  Musk was wise to wait until Spacex was clearly in the right before striking back publicly. This situation allows Spacex to announce to the world that they are no longer the new kid on the block. They will not be pushed around anymore without fighting back. The publicity will be good for Spacex long term. This argument, that cost is the least important factor, is incredibly absurd. In economics, cost is always one of the most important factors and it is precisely the reason why SpaceX would save the American taxpayer a significant amount of capital.   This happens because SpaceX has greatly improved upon the manufacturing of the rocket by using vertical integration to control the entire manufacturing process of rocketry. Business is cutthroat. Look at this from ULA's chair.   Scaling up three major initiatives - Tesla Motors, Solar City, and SpaceX - has to put a serious dent in the balance sheet. Pioneering isn't cheap.  Basic business strategy (Michael Porter): incumbents erect barriers to entry and deprive new entrants of cash. Locking up this market segment to 2019 seems like a fairly high but temporary barrier. Look for Lockheed / Boeing to ally against Musk's other endeavors. SpaceX needs to be booking launches at a much higher rate in the future than they can handle currently. That is fairly fundamental to growing a business. They are obviously going to scale up their production of cores and launch sites and everything else. The v1.1 has only been flying for 6 months. There is no reason to think the rate they can launch them will not improve. So I don't get that part of the argument at all. Lets not forget ULA is Lockheed Martin and Boeing. How late and over budget is the JSF? And the 787 wasn't exactly on time either. ""We need competition for government launches, but if it means driving ULA out of business and replacing its monopoly with a SpaceX one, Im not well gain that much in the long run.""  Where is the logic in this article?  How does the lawsuit represent driving ULA out of business and giving SpaceX a monopoly?   The author tried to hide they\'re weird feelings, but they really came out in the last sentence with this non-sequitur.  I would accept a logical arguement against the lawsuit but non is given (the argument that SpaceX hasn\'t performed is not an argument against the lawsuit).",138,,0

I was a bit shocked to learn here that he isn\'t a majority shareholder and that there isn\'t a special ownership class.  In other words, I was surprised to learn that he can ""easily"" be fired.  I had always wrongly assumed he had more ownership and was therefore able to stick behind some unpopular stances such as opening patents, remaining unprofitable during growth, and generally focusing on his mission of sustainable transport over the common shareholder goal of maximizing profits.

Basically I need:  * Information about the engines (specific impulse and fuel flow).  * For each stage, its coefficient of drag, radius, dry mass, wet mass, engine type and number of engines.  Anyway, that should be easy to implement because the code is modular and easy to extend. The main problem is gonna be the course-correction-less trajectory. To run it, the dependencies are numpy and matplotlib if you want fancy plots. Great start. The trajectory problem is difficult and I don't have any advice there, but I have a suggestion for improving your drag calculation. The model you used is only valid for incompressible flow, which generally means mach number less than about 0.5. You can get a pretty good approximation however by just multiplying the drag coefficient by a number proportional to mach number as follows:  mach 0-0.8: 1   mach 0.8-1: -7 + 10m   mach 1-1.5: 6.6 - 3.6m   mach 1.5+: 1.2    Plot:   These numbers are off the top of my head having looked at a number of plots at various points in the past, but it should get you closer anyways. AAAAAAHHHHH WHAT???!!? AWESOME!  This is excellent, I'm delighted somebody took mine further! Will definitely give it a look tomorrow as I'm just home and going straight to bed :) It's so beautifully compact though, man I should really learn Python...  Since, like my code, there's no nice user interface for the simulation, you should make some plots and create an imgur album for people to easily see exactly what the code does. Just a thought!  ____  Before I go I would share that for the whole course correction thing, I use the hazard maps to figure out what the magnitude and direction of the pitch kick should be (the booster stage should fall in the centre of the hazard area, more or less). Then I just do trial and error for course corrections during second stage flight. It's unique to each launch so unfortunately it's never as simple as you would like.  There is definitely potential for some really cool algorithm to pre-determine the corrections to end up in a perfectly circular orbit with as much fuel left as possible, etc. A genetic algorithm would be a very cool method. That's work for another time though :) You know what would be awesome?  That amazing talent on this sub (like yourself) puts their heads together for a while and makes a kickass trajectory simulation and optimization code with full graphical interface.  I have no doubt this sub could do it.  You know how freaking awesome it would be to create such an effective tool that it's essentially an ITAR violation?  But it's the internet, so I have no idea how ITAR would work there.  I suppose the US collaborators could go to jail.  Wouldn't that be awesome?! This is great stuff, as someone in his final year of CS, you're making me feel bad. I'm going to look at your code and see if I can extend it in any way though. Good job man! For those interested: see Wikipedia's article on guidance and control of [gravity turns](#Guidance_and_control). I forgot how pleasant it is to read python code - the way the syntax enforces neatness is so easy on the eye.   Some (bad) C coders work in a stream of consciousness, and you end up with a single-line, un-spaced, randomly-variable-named mess! You did this as a high school student?

OP, you really should of given credit for this. It belongs to /u/zlsa and /u/justatinker. Thanks! Here's the [original post]( One thing this doesn't mention is how the Earth's rotation is used as well to aid in getting back to the launch area. While the stage has slowed and flipped over, the Earth has turned underneath it some, so the path back is not the same as up. And even less so, with the barge landing. From what Hans said at the preflight press conference, I got the impression that the grid fins deploy before the retro burn.  What are others thinking on this?  /u/zlsa ? /u/justatinker ? What happens to the second stage?  Is it in a low enough orbit that it simply falls back to Earth after a few days? Awesome diagram...I wondered when you guys talked about different burns at different times.   This completely explains it.   Cool to see how they intelligently get the rocket headed back the right direction. Does the boostback burn really send the first stage up higher than the second stage?  Or is that just something to make everything fit nicely on the diagram? The boostback burn looks like an incredible waste of fuel. I don't get one thing: why is the first stage going unpowered above the second stage powered trajectory after separation? Shouldn't the second stage trajectory be drawn as in between the unpowered part of the first stage and then below the highest point the first stage reaches after boost back burn? This will do serious bad things for the clarity/readability of the diagram, for sure. &gt;max vertical speed 6 meters/second  For comparison, aircraft land with vertical speed of 2 meters/second  In other word ~400 feet/minute  Space x land at about 3 times faster than what normal passenger aircraft did.   Just sayin' Why the drone ship? I get that its safe, but surely using some remote desert location, e.g the White Sands Missile Range (3,200 sq miles) with a much bigger flattened landing area would increase the chances of landing tremendously as precision wouldnt be as important, only vertical speed, pitch &amp; yaw. You wouldnt have to deal with waves etc as well, and id imagine itd make it cheaper as well.",100,This is a pretty poor image.

Given the narrowness of the deck, and the wideness of the legs, they had about a 10 m +/- margin one way, and a 100 m +/- margin the other way. They managed to just miss the mark, in the dark and fog, on their first real try.  Some readers of Elon's tweets have suggested the problem was the vertical motion of the deck. This seems very likely. Predicting the motions due to waves more than a second or 2 in advance is all but impossible. Without the ability to hover and pick its moment to touch down, the first stage is very vulnerable during landing attempts. The Merlin engine cannot throttle down enough to allow hover. Perhaps the answer will be to make a slightly less powerful version of the engine for the center position. I believe the turbopumps can throttle lower, but the combustion chamber and bell do not allow lower thrust. A slightly smaller chamber and bell might allow hover, and save a little weight, with no other changes to the engine.  One of the things we can take away from this is that, if the landing attempt had been made back at Cape Canaveral, it would have had a much greater chance of success. No vertical motion, and there would have been a larger landing pad. It was a dark and foggy night; the deck heaved and pitched in the gloom as the rocket thundered down from the heavens...",9,,0

Question: could the electricity be used to turn water into hydrogen fuel? Is hydrogen fuel useable for spacecraft? If you had energy cells like 1000x as dense as what is available today.... it would probably be possible. Context? The [IMDB entry]( for the episode doesn't have a synopsis yet. If you could have very energy dense batteries, some inner propellant, and a very high Isp, maybe, but its certainly not possible atm or any time soon Musk is the man but every time he tweets I just laugh a little inside because next to all the other professionals he's tweeting 'u' 'cuz', and earlier, 'For realz' I worked on what was basically an ""ion drive"" in my graduate research project.   While the engines are extremely efficient, they just don\'t have near the output that chemical propulsion does. So until we can figure out how to break physics, we are stuck with chemical propulsion. I like that Elon uses the word ""cuz"". Maybe if he tried using an inanimate carbon rod... There's been a lot of discussion of non-traditional rockets in this thread and [Atomic Rockets]( is a very good resource for learning about those. As I promised /u/bertcox, he did break this first, like 3 months ago [here]( but I deleted it for being fluffy/the sun. Even if they invented batteries with a much higher power density and ion engines with a much higher thrust to weight they would still require some kind of physical propellant because of the law of conservation of momentum. Newton's laws are a bitch. Throwing objects around the Earth isn't easy. Not to be confused with The Simpson's jab at the [electric car]( to which Elon will promptly disregard. Railgun doesn't count? You could get a fair bit of the way with an electric plane, but that is a long way out still The episode of The Simpsons was disappointing. It had a lot of good gags, but the episode didn't flow, and Musk's delivery was crazy flat.  I enjoyed the episode (it was fun as a fan), but it was a mediocre episode in the general sense. he should have said ""it is cuz we\'re waiting for someone to prove that it can work, and earn their place in the SpaceX team"" That's unpossible!! Early humans thought space travel in general was impossible. Look where we are now. In the future humans are going to look back on that quote and be amazed at how little we knew was possible Improbable* That's quitter talk.  Go build me an electric rocket engine! Perhaps one day with antimatter engines we can have SSTO craft that are small and light, but right now the antimatter would cost more than 10000 SLS rockets. What about project orion? I mean: can anything be better than nuking things to space? He seems almost pained and pissed at how one Simpsons episode caused so many ""enthusiasts"" to jump at him to the tune of ""Do something like *that* if you wanna be crowned as cool as you think you are"" electric rockets have great ISP but basically zero thrust.",300,"Well, its not impossible, just not well-developed technology that anyone has used: Is Reddit where people who don't know how to use Twitter go to find out what people said on Twitter?  I don't think there should be a blanket banning of posting Tweets on here, since sometimes they are critical updates.  But stuff like this? A silly set of tweets he made about why other tech isn't realistic? Elon needs to put his money where his mouth is on this one and do a large scale test of the cannae drive that NASA tested a while back.   Don't get me wrong -- I would expect the outcome to be that it's disproven as a technology. But for gods sake *someone* needs to run more tests on the damn thing. Where's my god damn flying car....and dont give me this safety crap... No propellant, no space elevator (or other exotic materials), and no railguns? Two options:  1. Launch loop  still needs a chemical upper stage to circularize, but it's tiny 2. Space elevator  I see no problem  Active structures are the answer. No it is not. Elon just doesn't dream big enough.  In order to do electric SSTO you just need to build a launching tube several miles long that powers and accelerates the rocket all the way through it. As it exits the tube at hypersonic velocities you will need to be at a high altitude so the craft does not liquify upon exiting.  It's not impossible it would just take govt. Uhhh, believe it or not, Elon Musk is actually [wrong](  ""A magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thruster (MPDT) is a form of electrically powered spacecraft propulsion which uses the Lorentz force (the force on a charged particle by an electromagnetic field) to generate thrust.""  ""In **theory** [emp. mine], MPD thrusters could produce extremely high specific impulses (Isp) with an exhaust velocity of up to and beyond 110,000 m/s, triple the value of current xenon-based ion thrusters, and about 25 times better than liquid rockets.""  So why don\'t we do this? Energy and weight. In order to achieve the thrust to meet or exceed liquid fuels, you\'d need a whopping huge energy source such as a nuclear power plant. But that increases your take-off weight past what you can actually get off the ground with. So you\'re stuck burning liquid fuels in a controlled explosion for the foreseeable future.  So impossible? With energy tech right now, yes. Once you have better batteries or reactors that can take the weight factor out? Doable.",22

From Robert Zubrin interview below. He does not discuss how much infrastructure is required. Who wants to pay for all the infrastructure while we wait though? If people are already there, that becomes a big incentive to actually terraform.   Form the article:  1. A century to settle Mars and create a substantial local industrial capability and population.   2. A half century producing fluorocarbon gases (like CF4) to warm the planet by ~10 C.   3. A half century for CO2 to outgas from the soil under the impetus of the fluorocarbon gases, thickening the atmosphere to 0.2 to 0.3 bar, and raising the planetary temperature a further 40 C. This will cause water to melt out of the permafrost, and rivers to flow and rain to fall. Radiation doses on the surface will also be greatly reduced. Under these conditions, with active human help, first photosynthetic microbes and then ever more complex plants could be spread over the planet, as they would be able to grow in the open. Humans on Mars in this stage would no longer need pressure suits, just oxygen masks, and very large domed cities could be built, as the domes would no longer need to contain pressure greater than the outside environment.  4. Over a period of about a thousand years, human-disseminated and harvested plants would be able to put ~150 mbar (millibars) of oxygen in the Martian atmosphere. Once this occurs, humans and other animals will be able to live on Mars in the open, and the world will become fully alive. - See more at: #sthash.5f4mi5ej.dpuf  Edit: Formatting The answer to the question, ""would it makes sense to terraform [or even \'start terraforming\'] Mars before going there"", is ""no"".  Going to Mars, for short visits at least, is something we\'re already technologically capable of, and can probably afford to do in the very short term if we decide we want to.  Making any serious effort at starting to terraform Mars would be (will be...?) a huge undertaking that would likely dwarf any other space-based project we\'ve ever done.  And by ""serious"" I mean not just some experiment that tests out some chemical reaction on Mars, but taking steps that will make a measurable change to the Martian atmosphere.  In the much longer-term, whether we do some sort of large-scale chemical factory/processor, or bombard the surface with a few dozen comets or something else entirely, it\'s probably at a *minimum* most of a century away. NO. Current technology is immature and it is going to be a guess, experiment, see what happens, repeat type of situation - strictly hands-on by humans.  Terraforming the next planet after Mars may or may not go a lot smoother and quicker. Your question has a lot of parallels to the climate change issue. The climate of Terra has been changing slowly for the last 100 years due to manmade causes. However, the people that were burning the coal and oil 100 years ago are all dead now and the effects of their actions didn\'t have very serious consequences for them. Now we are having to deal with the effects of our ancestors did, but we don\'t really have to deal with the effects of all the CO*_2_* that we\'re currently producing. It\'s our children and their children that will suffer for our shortsightedness. Our civilisation might be approaching a kind of maturity that will change the way future generations plan things and thing long term, but I think up until now, humanity has been very shortsighted and childlike.  Terraforming Mars will also be a multi-century effort. Nobody (even spacegeeks like me) would want to invest in terraforming Mars for centuries before we sent anyone there. The people who will be most invested in terraforming Mars will be the people with the most to gain from it, the people living there.   Edit: Read ""Red Mars"" or ""The Case For Mars"" if you want to see what terraforming Mars will probably look like. I have to say, halfway through reading the Mars Trilogy makes me kind of hope we never do large scale terraforming.  It'd be expensive either way, and it's definitely a much different sort of existence to be in giant dome cities forever with a rather hostile environment on the other side of the airlock, but it'd also be nice to live somewhere that wasn't just Earth II and let parts of Mars stay Mars; being able to put on a suit and explore a planet that's as we found it away from the cities. Particularly until we've fully explored the question of whether there's any traces of past life hidden away in some corner.  It also makes me hope we don't just strip mine every square inch of it for export; take what we need to build up there, but leave large scale exploitation for the asteroids. I have never seen a good argument for terraforming any planet. It's far too energy expensive. The only terraforming that's really worthwhile would be on the order of climate change. Well, it'd be nice, but seeing as it'll take thousands of years, I'm feeling a little too impatient to wait that long. No, terraforming will start after we get there. The first few missions will likely be science missions, and will make an effort not to have a significant impact on the place. After we have a pretty good picture of the way Mars is now, and probably a a decent sized outpost that is continually crewed, then we may start terraforming. I'm sad to see the score of this post (currently 0). This is a good question and entirely relevant to SpaceX.    My two cents : it's not an absurd idea, and I like the notion of a distant future when we select planets / moons for colonisation and then launch a terraforming process before settling. But it's not appropriate for Mars, we want to go there first and then maybe start thinking about it.    We don't really know how much or how fast or how well it would work, and it would take many decades at the *very* least to make a significant difference. If we wait for terraforming to go, we may wait centuries. Besides, if you can send enough machines there to make a significant impact, you can easily send hundreds of humans as well. I can imagine pitching a venture capital firm with this idea.   ""Blah, blah, blah ... terraforming ... blah, blah, blah ... climate changes gradually over decades ... blah, blah, blah ... inhabitable for our pioneering great great grandchildren. Any questions?""  ""Just one, our investment should begin paying off in how many centuries?"" It's not a factory. It's biotech. I'd be down with developing the future life that we'll eventually seed on Mars.  Or even the actual factories we'd have to deploy in order to create the super greenhouse gasses.  Not necessarily deploying them. I have a bit of a different take. Even if terraforming was cheap and easy why would we want to any time soon? We know so little about Mars history and the possibility that life existed at some point is still an open question. I don't think terraforming should occur until many many years of research and exploration have been done. To do otherwise would be unethical IMO. No. It will take people to explore Mars thoroughly for native microbial life. Remotely operated robots are too slow, too limited in their mobility, and too limited in their ability to react to the unexpected. For all we know, Curiosity might have spent the last 2 years crunching over fossils that a good geologist would have recognized in 2 hours.  It would be a crime o terraform Mars in such a way that native Martian life is rendered extinct. We will have to study Mars, probably for another 50 years or a century, including live visits, before we can be certain no life survives anywhere, and if we can terraform Mars in ways that preserve the native life, (which I think can be done, but we won\'t really know until we go there in person.)  In what I\'ve just said, I was answering a slightly different question than yours, ""Would it make sense to begin terraforming Mars before going there?"" Mars is a big place. Even if we started terraforming Mars tomorrow, I think the task will take at least 1000 years, and possibly 10,000 years. Also, I think the task would go much slower without humans working on the surface.  I think asking people to wait over 1,000 years is not practical, no matter what you think of the ethical issues. Paraterraforming (in which you ""terraform"" just the areas you want to live in by enclosing them in tents and domes) seems vastly easier, faster, more efficient (why create an entire atmosphere if you\'re only going to make use of the 5% near the ground?), and more ethically straightforward.  It\'s a near-term achievable goal with all of the benefits and none of the downsides. In my mind the key issue here is that we know very little about Mars, we have been there 0 times in person. Before you endeavour to take on a planetary scale project, you should deeply understand that planet. I would think if we would want to warm Mars up we would use water vapor over co2.  Do something like in total recall and nuke the ice caps into melting.  If you want to terraform, you have to do it fast.  There's no way you could put togerher a sustained 1k year effort.  Well need massive amounts of disposable energy before we could even contemplate such an effort.",96,"Think you will need to terraform Mars if you want to live on the surface. As it stands the thin atmosphere offers little protection against solar/cosmic radiation and meteors, which will pose a continued threat to surface dwellers. However, effective terraforming would generate a thick atmosphere and magnetosphere which reduces or even removes those threats in the long term.    If they decide to terraform Mars, human participation will be essential, people are just indispensible for surveying in-situ resources, manufacturing, setting up and maintaining the necessary equipment required for terraforming. Yes colonists will be at risk from the terraforming process but in the long term they will be at greater risk from prevailing surface conditions if they decide not to terraform.  Terraforming could be accomplished relatively quickly (less than a millennium) using the same natural process used to terraform Earth. Earth's core contains a [georeactor]( which is a [natural fission reactor](  generating around a terawatt of power. After our planet was formed this reactor forced [huge amounts of water vapour and other gasses]( to the surface which then evolved into our seas and atmosphere. Our active core also helps to generate a healthy magnetosphere which protects us from solar/cosmic radiation and stops our atmosphere from being stripped away by solar wind, similar to what has occurred on Mars.  There is increasing evidence that Mars had oceans and an atmosphere - until its geothermal activity slowed. Hence to reverse the process (and terraform Mars) you will probably need to kickstart Mars' georeactor. Volcanic activity ceased on Mars around 100-200 millions years ago so large amounts of fissile materials/actinides should still be present in the core. If you follow the evacuated lava tunnels down then drill to the core, you can then load it with a relatively small amount of [uranium/plutonium, sourced locally from Mars]( Having replenished some of the georeactor's nuclear fuel the core should restart locally. A georeactor is essentially a fast breeder reactor, so it will start to make its own fuel, increasing the reaction rate and consequent power output. Within a relatively short time Mars' georeactor core should be restored and start pumping out colossal amounts of water vapour and gases trapped underground. These gases should be retained at the surface by a strong magnetosphere also generated by the increased core activity, possibly many times stronger than Earth's, which should help compensate for the reduced gravity.    Lastly, self replicating synthetic organisms would be required to convert the pyroclastic gases into a breathable atmosphere. This conversion process should increase exponentially as the organisms multiply, in a similar process to how our own atmosphere was [oxygenated by organic microbes]( 2.3 billion years ago.    Terraforming is a true mega-project, and however daunting, you need to dare to think big. No. Zero sense.  To be blunt.",0

Odd, i could read this just fine. Anyway, gonna copy paste it all here if that is ok;  April 15, 2015 7:13 am **SpaceX shoots down rival United Launch Alliances prospects**  Robert Wright in Colorado Springs SpaceX's Falcon 9 spacecraft, with the Dragon reusable capsule, sits on the launch pad on May 18, 2012 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket is being prepared for a May 19 lift off to hold systems tests and complicated maneuvers. The tests will confirm if the Dragon will be allowed to dock with the International Space Station. The most ambitious mission ever launched in the history of commercial spaceflight is scheduled to get under way at 4:55 am on May 19.   SpaceX, Elon Musks fast-growing US space launch provider, has dismissed plans by its main rival to revamp to handle growing competition, saying United Launch Alliance remains far from being a real commercial provider.  Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, was speaking after ULA on Monday revealed plans for a overhauled launch system known as Vulcan.  ULA, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture that handles all US national security rocket launches, said the new system would enable it to cut launch costs. It also said it would achieve the groundbreaking capability to use successive launches of parts of a vast spacecraft then assemble the parts in orbit.  However, Ms Shotwell dismissed her rivals claims. I dont know why they think they have an edge, she said of the capabilities the new craft would provide. I think were already better.  Ms Shotwell was speaking to the Financial Times on the sidelines of the annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. Tory Bruno, ULAs chief executive, had earlier expressed concern at the symposium about the financial effects of a looming decline in US military satellite launches.  SpaceX expects later this year to become the only ULA competitor certified to launch US military satellites, with the two poised to compete for all national security launches starting in 2019.  However, Ms Shotwell said SpaceX could accommodate a dip in government business because it had lots of room in other sectors it served, while ULA depended almost entirely on government revenue.  Mr Bruno said this week that the Vulcans average launch cost should be below $100m and that it would compete for commercial business. SpaceX offers some launches of its Falcon 9 rocket for as little as $60m.  They have lots of strategising to do on how theyre going to turn themselves into a real commercial provider, Ms Shotwell said of ULA.  SpaceX on Tuesday successfully launched its latest mission to the International Space Station for Nasa, the US space agency. However, it failed in an effort to recover one of the rockets boosters, which crashed on to an autonomous barge.  ULAs supporters argue that its excellent reliability justifies its higher costs. The company has undertaken 95 launches since being formed in 2006 and suffered only one partial failure, when a satellite was put into an excessively low orbit. The orbit was later successfully corrected.  However, Ms Shotwell insisted that SpaceXs record with the Falcon 9  17 successful launches, after Tuesdays flight  was better than ULAs. SpaceX lost a customers satellite in 2012 but completed that flights main mission, to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.  We have focused on reliability from the beginning, Ms Shotwell said. We think we have a very reliable vehicle architecture.  Ms Shotwell said SpaceXs record and technology would enable it to become the most powerful operator in fields far beyond serving the US military.  We will become the dominant provider of space launch, she said.  #  &gt;However, Ms Shotwell dismissed her rivals claims. I dont know why they think they have an edge, she said of the capabilities the new craft would provide. I think were already better.  That is a very dangerous and so far unwarranted stance to take. This is kind of thing i would read on /r/SpaceX but disappointing to hear it from Shotwell. [I kinda responded to this kind of thinking here.]( This is the kind of corporate posturing and counter posturing that sells news subscriptions. However it does little to contribute to the understanding of the firms' vision or their ability to execute. It sacrifices potentially useful discussion of competitors' strengths and weaknesses for a rah-rah from the choir. If this were the level of discourse I wanted, I'd go into politics. Informative article but i didn't feel like the context of Shotwell's comments was captured. Hard to say what she really meant with her quotes.  I will say, I completely agree with Shotwell's comments, I dont know why ULA thinks they have an edge. If you go by history, they absolutely do by record, but that isn't an edge moving forward. I dont buy ULA's reason for going for a fully reusable 1st stage because the break even is too many launches. I think they are not going that direction is a number of reasons. They don't use the multiple engine configuration of Spacex which allows only 3 then 1 engine to be used in the return, without this, landing a 1st stage is impossible as you cannot throttle rocket engines down low enough. It also appears they are not going clean sheet redesign, which would be needed to engineer the structure to handle reusability. Lastly, the coding required to pull this off must be extremely complex. Watching the Vine of the return shows how crazy adaptive and responsive the code and rocket needs to be.   In my opinion, if I am a ULA engineer, I see the writing on the wall. ULA has a very real possibility of going bankrupt in 10 years time as this Vulcan rocket needs to be something competitive in that amount of time. Spacex will be certified for the same exact government missions that ULA currently survives on. Spacex's CURRENT rocketry already is competitive, if not beats the Vulcan, and if projections hold, Spacex will be an order of magnitude cheaper than the Vulcan. Think about that....if the Vulcan was flying right now, it would not be a shoe in to be better than spacex's falcon 9.1 (it would be but not by a whole lot). I really hope ULA get their shit together and become competitive. Same goes for Arianespace, Roxcosmos and the rest of the launchers. Replacing all of them with SpaceX just leaves us with an overall monopoly and that's only good for 1 person. I get the sense that ULA has a reliability edge, just not the one mentioned in the article. ULA's strength is its ability to launch on-time the first time, as well as its ability to launch with very little notice. Both of these aspects are naturally very important to national-security launches.   Am I right?",35,So they named the rocket after the god of fire? Birmingham has a statue of him. The kids used to call him vulgar. I guess it was because he had a bare bottom.,0

Can SpaceX continue to tweak landing software to adequately meet the challenges of landing on a barge? Likely, but the ocean conditions, unknown fuel remaining weight, and wind conditions will all still provide an element of randomness for these landings that are a lot harder to manage with a barge landing.

Was that a controlled shutdown of one of the engines that caused the attitude change? I like this version much better, being able to see the full burn! Nice. Not quite 100% optimal, but for a new style system(capsule wall engines) it did its duty.     The wind: You can see where in the NASA feed(SpaceX feed was a bit lacking for multiple views) after the capsule touched down, the chutes pulled it a bit hard and tipped the capsule sideways temporary.    Parachutes: Nice for them to be able to deploy at such a low altitude. Simple without multiple parachute stages.    Engine anomalies:  One engine a slight bit off in burn and other engines need a bit faster/accurate correction, but still good.    Splash down: Really, it was a touch more gentle than other companies abort tests. The Cargo Dragon does a big ass splash, as seen from a distance.  Both versions do the angle splash to dissipate speed, which is due to the parachute anchor position.

This bill also included the option to lease inflatable modules from private industry. I can't wait to see this thing operational on the ISS. Mark Watney suggests double checking the airlock seams of the inflatable hab. I find the strong design and construction parallels between this and [Lightsail]( intriguing. Whatever happened to the Genesis modules that Bigelow launched back in the day?  Are they still in orbit?  Are they still holding air? Can't wait for BA330 to fly, mostly because it'll provide some more missions for the commercial crew and cargo vehicles. Thats really my big concern about those programs, other than ISS none of those vehicles have any seriously proposed missions, and thats only like 20something missions total until the expected end of ISS. Seems like a shame to spend so much money developing those vehicles just for a couple flights each. The Bigelow stations (and possibly other commercially operated stations), either privately run or as a replacement for ISS, could provide another decade of missions for those vehicles post ISS. Does it seem weird to anyone that they're putting this on the ISS and they're not even sure what they're going to use it for?",79,,0

There's some design reference architectures spoken about with the SLS. But honestly there is no way they will be the first to Mars.      Our wiki has a lot of info on this as well:    Specifically: Theres the MIT study on Mars One   And a quick google turned up one done by Inspiration Mars (though I'm fairly certain they're just planning to do an 'Apollo 8')  and I even found one by some Russians regarding using nuclear propulsion but it seems to be behind a paywall [This]( is a little tangential, but might give you a good idea of how people approach looking at such problems. Well, there's this one analysing Mars One &gt;What the estimated cost  As the saying goes: if you want to know the cost, you're probably in the wrong shop. It will cost bales upon bales of nylon/paper and gallons of sweat. Guys,  Realistically, unless China or private companies foot the bill, there will not be a human mission to Mars before 2036.  And even then it will not be a permanent base.  There will not be any need for a MCT until at least 2050.  Here is my timescale, it is based on existing technologies, but the process for getting things approved, planned, paid for and built is so difficult that it will get shot down by different US administrations.  The political will is NOT there for long term STEM projects.  Would the USA have footed CERN, no way, the US administration is only worried about the next election, not something maybe 20 or 50 years down the road.

So I have a minimum of 22 Launches, alone with a price tag of 200m per Dragon that is a massive 4.4BN US.  Now you could probably double that for all of the other habs, modules and trasnsit vehicles and have a minimum of 9BN.  If anyone other then Biggelow and SpaceX build them, it will cost around 100Bn.

If people aren't convinced this is a major upgrade to Falcon 9, they should be now. F9v1.2 / F9FT! I'm curious, if the SES-9 first stage is recovered, is there any chance that SpaceX will give in to the request of SES to fly the recovered stage? IMO they could after they recover another stage and take that apart. I hate the fact that I routinely wish large periods of my life would slip away faster just so I can see the next SpaceX launch. Lots of good information in this article. It's exciting to see that launch customers are as eager for re-usability as we are. the octawebs were upgraded over a year ago, they're just now making it into flight we are talking about thrust increases arent we? Well more thrust is nice but doesnt that change almost nothing when the efficiency doesnt increase?  I mean you might save some fuel by powering faster through the atmosphere - to some extend since drag increases exponentialy but beyond that? Okay another thing is that you might be able to decrease the Stage 1 burn time - allowing staging to happen earlier and this way decrease the amount fuel needed land on the barge  since you accelerate less back down due to being not as high?  ...an increase in thrust sounds nice but I dont see too much of a value - especially in thelong term with relaunching - more thrust will decrease lifetime.  edit: okay another small advantage might be on the FH...you might be able to throttle down the core booster even more when the strap ons have a good enough throust/weight ratio...this might dramatically increase the performance - but thats not an issue today.",95,,0

Very interesting idea i don't think cloning is needed for space colonization. it will probably play a role for individuals who purposely want to send specific genetic copies of themselves, loved ones, or famous people to another planet. but cloning would be an unnecessary step in colonization. sending a sperm and egg bank for the purpose of IVF would be better than clones for starting a new population. it will ensure a continual source of diverse genes and combination of gametes. whereas with clones, they would probably be selected by paying customers and a ship full of cloned embryos selected on personal preferences might not start off genetically diverse. also, you can't combine the clones until they are fully grown or at least reach a gestational age when their gametes can be harvested, which is an added surgical risk. if the clones die, their genetics could be lost, while a sperm/egg bank would still have reserves. it was my impression that the sciences and medical field also have lots of experience with IVF, but not as much with cloning. and that cloning is much more technically difficult and uses up more gametes in failed attempts.  either way, clones or IVF babies need surrogate mothers or artificial wombs. they also need some kind of infrastructure to support their development. i imagine that either robots or adult humans would have to create a self sufficient base before they can think about adding more mouths to feed. if they can't get more colonists, they will probably have to resort to IVF with the sperm/egg bank to enlarge the active gene pool, before they allow natural reproduction. or, they might allow couples to have 1 natural child but the rest to be surrogate children, at least for the first several generations. or, all IVF children might be artificially gestated. but i wonder what social consequences that would make. would they be as loved as natural children would be? would the other adults or children treat them the same way? very interesting to see what would happen, although it probably wouldn't happen in our lifetimes. if the spacex dream comes true, there will probably be plenty of colonists for intrasystem locations. artificial reproduction would probably be more for livestock, crops, and terraforming.   my guess is that artificial reproduction in humans would be more relevant for interstellar colonization. generation ships would require a huge mass penalty. i also imagine that the target planet would have to be very earth-like or the first colonists would never be self-sufficient. the first exploratory probes send before even considering colonization would have to be very thorough, and mission control would have to keep track of the probe missions for generations when some governments or countries don't even last that long, much less legislative approval or funding. Easily the stupidest post I've ever seen on reddit.",9,,0

Looking back at the previous 5 years the development path seems really obvious for what they had to do next but im not as clear from here on out.

Could SpaceX remove some of the engines from the F9 1st stage, put a modified capsule (such as perhaps bigger windows and no heat shield) directly on top (no 2nd stage), and compete head to head with Blue Origin in the tourism market for relatively little additional R&amp;D, possibly even beating them to market? (Regardless of whether or not they *should* or *would*. This is a question about feasibility.) They should try working together.  Musk could use the Bezos rocket for DragonFly testing, and in return he could give Bezos some slightly used Dragons after 2017 for use in the ride version of the Bezos project.

Let me have some November still! How do you spell hype? ;) Hi, I'm new to SpaceX stuff. Will they try another first stage landing during RTF? Let's talk the Blue Origin landing.   What are the benefits to the Blue Origin design?   Seems like the surface area is smaller for the leg extension range, could this cause it to tip over?   Does Falcon 9 do a preflight grid fin and leg extension check on the pad?   Does Falcon 9 need some drag flaps on the interstage?   Can this design be scaled up to fit a Falcon 9 class first and second stage?  Will the Blue Origin capsule have any launch escape system?  Keep on hopping Bezos. [The story I posted recently]( had a quote from a former NASA Deputy Administrator about some in NASA not being happy with SpaceX pushing beyond LEO, as that\'s ""their space"".  CRS-2 is likely to be the last, or one of the last, NASA commercial contracts on the horizon.  It will be a sizable contract as well.  Do you guys think that Musk will delay any unveiling of his Mars plans until after the CRS-2 contract announcement, to prevent animosity over the plans possibly coloring the outcome of the award? What, if any, amount of mass could Falcon 9 V1.2 throw to mars and still be re-usable? What amount of mass could Falcon Heavy throw to mars and still be re-usable? How much value still exists in landing the last Falcon 9 v1.1 that'll be used in the Jason-3 launch?  I know the flight profile is different from 1.1 FT, so the landing profile must be different too, but is it still worthwhile practice for them?  And I imagine there are enough similarities between the 1.1 and 1.1 FT versions that if they recover the stage, they can still do meaningful tests on it.  Has there been any discussion on this? Is the ""11 December"" date set in the sidebar for the ""Orbcomm OG2 Launch 2"" correct and confirmed? Any details on the improvements to the landing legs and grid fins for the Falcon 9 Full Thrust (v1.2) upgrade? What needs to happen to allow SpaceX to attempt an on land first stage return? How far does Bezos' physics/engineering ability exactly reach? Do we know how involved he is in the project? I haven't heard much from him regarding the technicalities of spaceflight. Elon Musk = Henry (Hank) Rearden?    In the long chain of comments recently posted regarding NDT, he was suggested as a modern industrialist.     I think this is appropriate, and if the question does not need explanation (i.e. you already are familiar with the source)  there are a lot of comparisons:  Anti-dog-eat-dog legislation, Direct government support/interference, Aspirations and goals that do not include a political necessity.    Hank Rearden ""won"" in my reading.  Elon Musk I believe will win as well.    Andrew Beall lost - but prior to Elon, I would have likened him to Hank Rearden as well.  Thoughts? Do you think the EM Drive or Cannae Drive will be used in the next 10 years on actual spacecraft? Just wondering because I haven't seen a comparison anywhere, but what is the size comparison between the Delta Heavy and Falcon Heavy? Never really crossed my mind till now! Will the raptor-powered BFR be a single stick design like the F9 or a multi stick like what the Falcon Heavy will be?  Or will they make both versions of this rocket family as well? Perhaps this is a better place to ask. In another thread I see:  &gt; Official confirmation that the Falcon 9 first stage is capable of single-stage-to-orbit flight when launched without upper stage &amp; payload.  To which I wonder: is this just referring to the energy in the fuel vs the weight of the stage? My understanding is the stage isn't capable of MECO followed by 45 minute cold soak in space followed by restarting the engine on the other side of the earth to circularize the orbit.   Or is it? This is probably a silly question, but ... inspired by this:  &gt; SpaceX - Would Space Travel Flourish If We Could Reuse The Rockets?  I wonder: once Crew Dragon is operational, with propulsive landing, would it be possible to, say, launch from a Falcon 9 and then land the Dragon on the other side of the planet, without ever doing a full orbit? Basically, think of it like a $100,000,000 flight where you could go from Florida to New Zealand in under an hour.  Totally ridiculous, I know ... but would it be possible? This might have already been asked. (I know that there's basically no use for this information, it is pure curiosity) But what platforms does the people at spacex use? From the engineers AMA I got that the OS on board is an in house Linux. But what about the engineers designing the engines and everything? I doubt they run the CAD programs on Linux and certainly the people on management are probably running Windows. If anyone has any information about this I'd be very glad. (And if anyone knows anything about Elon as well, very much appreciated.) THanks a lot everyone! Hope to see you all in Mars someday... Are there reliable sources on what color the BFR is going to be? In my head, I've always pictured an off-yellow color, but there's absolutely no basis for that. Some pictures I've seen (fan art) have the same motif as the Falcon family, just scaled way way up and with different proportions. But that seems kinda... Lame.  And if no one has any reliable sources, does anyone want to speculate with me about it? Question for everyone, how is it that Stage 2 separates so well in almost every case? By the time Stage 1 burns out the rocket is so high that I can't imagine the atmosphere would play any role in stability of the second stage. So how does it get pushed and not start to veer left, right, ect? Do they just have the center of mass down to such a small point that it continues to fly strait? Furthermore if Stage 2 were to veer of course could it correct? When is Blue Origin planning to deliver payload to orbit for paying customers? The company is pretty secretive and I couldn't find the info online. It's nearly time for the annual subreddit survey, any questions you'd like to see asked? Has there been any info about the RTF date since [this tweet]( Anything at all? What are the chances of a mid December launch still happening? Although Musk has spoken of initial crews striving to stay, if during the early stages of settlement a vehicle were to return to Earth, how could near-term technology reduce its reentry speed from Earth-Mars transit? Dynamic aerobraking, magneto-plasma aeroshell, multiple gravity-assisted passes, reversed ion drives...? Thanks (wondering how to best reply to skeptics who voice concern over ""prohibitively fast"" reentry speeds) I haven't been keeping up with SpaceX in the last 6 or so months. I've been checking here and there the last few days but I am completely out of the loop. What's new? What's in the works and have they had any significant advances towards... Well anything they're advancing towards?   Edit: Thanks y'all. What is this I hear about Elon not liking wings/fins on spacecraft? Is that purely a technical reasoning behind it (i.e not wanting to add unnecessary complexity or control surfaces where the RCS should to the job just fine by itself) or is it an aesthetic thing (the next generation spacecraft should look like *this*, and not have wings)? How fucked is SpaceX if the RTF has a launch failure? Ive seen a bunch of single core MCT fan renders with no second stage, Why is that?  Wouldn't a Mars rocket like BFR NEED a 2nd stage to help push a 100+ ton MCT into Orbit? I highly doubt that with MCT loaded BFR is an SSTO, so why the single booster  IMO BFR will be a BIG falcon rocket for the first stage, then have a reusable second stage, and finally MCT will be a reusable MAV that would look kind of like Mars direct meets NASA DRM 5.0 Aeroshell. Was the Outer Space Treaty a good idea and did it destroy the interest for space exploration? Was there down-looking onboard video for the last 2 landing attempts?  If so, why haven't they released it (and been so picky in general about releasing videos?) I realize spacex isn't currently planning on developing 2nd stage landing, but just hypothetically: Why use hypergolic engines (i.e. superdracos)? This is all I have heard discussed. Why not use small, kerosene-lox vernier engines? This would save a significant amount of weight. Would it even be possible to use the main engine turbopump exhaust a source of thrust? I don't know if there would be issues with running the turbopump without the combustion chamber firing. The turbopump exhaust could be redirected to smaller gimbaled nozzles, and fully burned with oxygen pressure fed from the tank. Throttling could be achieved by changing the mixture. Or alternatively you could use a sea-level version of Kestrel. I don't know if you could get enough thrust purely from blow-down pressurization to land? Would this work? I know it would add complexity and weight, which would be major counter-arguments, but it still seems simpler to tack on than adding a whole new fuel system for superdracos. Or maybe not? The special announcement december 10th, is that a SpaceX event or is it ""just"" a SpaceX Stats redesign? Not precisely spacex, but I hope it's still okay to ask in this thread:  Does Blue Origin's new rocket do a reentry burn? I know F9's burns go   1. Primary launch burn 2. Boostback burn 3. Reentry burn 4. Landing burn  Of course Blue Origin's rocket needs to do 1 and 4, and of course since it's suborbital, it doesn't need a boostback. But does it do a reentry like F9 does? Can Crew Dragon land on the moon?  In it's current state, almost certainly not due to delta-v limitations, but Elon has hinted that it could (don't remember the exact source, though.)  What kind of modifications would be needed, or is this even possible in theory?  Could you maybe put extra fuel tanks in the trunk and tie into the main propulsion system via the fueling ports? I came across this a few minutes ago. Any truth to it?  &gt; There are two technologies to pressurize liquid propellants which are essentially unexploited today that I know of. Each gives turbo pump performance without the expense or engineering difficulties of the same. Obviously, weight control is always very important, neither of these necessarily has any weight penalty over turbopumps. &gt;  &gt;  Ultracentrifugal Rocket Engine. &gt;  &gt;  Pistonless Pump Rocket Engine. &gt;  &gt; Both have the ghosts of long prior art flitting around them, and patents which are probably bustable, if no current IP holders will be reasonable. What are the costs, in terms of propellant usage, for  1) Boostback burn (RTLS vs. ASDS)  2) Re-entry burn  3) Landing burn  Intuitively I want to say the boostback will always be the most expensive of the three if you aren\'t landing at sea, because you have to null out ~1.8km/sec and ~60km downrange, which is growing FAST while the stage is coasting as it turns around (about 1m 30s for CRS-6). This suggests that the barges are here to stay, and not simply a feature of the landing development program. The numbers are sure to be different with more lofted trajectories and FH side cores, but it still seems that there is a much larger performance penalty than other phases of flight.  The re-entry burn is also an interesting unknown (at least to me) because it has two purposes: braking and protection. Another thing I\'m trying to understand is: what percentage of the deceleration is directly due to thrust vs. aero braking? In other words, you need a certain amount of thrust to create a ""bubble"" that protects the rocket from compression heating. Does the aero braking cause much more deceleration than the minimum thrust required, or is it inherently close to 1:1?  **EDIT:** I have answers, some of which are thanks to /u/FoxhoundBat\'s calculations and some cool graphs from /u/TheVehicleDestroyer\'s site.  The relationship between boostback (to barge), re-entry, and landing burns appears to be roughly [3/6ths, 2/6ths, and 1/6th respectively]( (for ease of envisioning fuel expended in relative proportion)  [Supersonic retropropulsion drag augmentation, relationship between thrust used compared to basic aero drag]( - thanks to [this video]( and spending a bit more time thinking about what the numbers mean. How many more days before the new patch is revealed? Any guesses? Maybe next week? Beyond hands on experience and listed skills on the career pages, what skills and traits does SpX look for in recent graduates (BS)? I have a whole slew of different kinds of skills from programming (C,C++,MATLAB, some ASM, ect.) embedded to desktop systems, machining, some composite work, CFD, FEA, CAD, propulsion knowledge (both turbine and rocket), anything learned in ME undergrad (fluid and thermal systems, numerical methods, orbital mechanics, dynamics, gas dynamics, ect.) and just a passion for rockets.    I guess what I am asking is: how can I emphasize and illustrate that in a cover letter? Those of you who work for SpX, what more can I do to better prepare myself?   edit: if I already missed a call from a recruiter earlier in the semester, I didn't screw myself over right? What software does SpaceX use in house to determine orbital trajectory and needed rocket thrust and guidance to get there? Are there standard packages used in the space industry? Is there an open source version?  We all discuss capabilities but someone has to sit down and program the rockets to burn for certain durations and thrust levels at certain angles and that info has to come from some software package.  Now every company MIGHT write their own from scratch but there is a lot of danger in that and certainly by now there have to be some standard codes sources from nasa etc for this. Plus you need to know gravity variations in the earth etc to be accurate and individual rocket companies can\'t be gathering that info themselves.  Does Nasa have open source software to do this?  Are there code modules most rocket companies use?  Or can you just do it all  without preprogramming by telling a ""smart"" rocket ""aim for a certain angle to  north at this height"" and then give the rocket computer basic instructions such as""thrust more of height is below desired target"" and ""turn if nagle is wrong"" with some limits like ""dont exceed max atmospheric q "" running off an impact air sensor.  It seems like the latter method would handle engine out scenarios better than programming specific solutions to every possible eventuality.  Anyway its one of those basic things that is never talked about. Has anyone heard any plans for the second stage burns after primary mission completion on the next flight?  Lots of excess capability right?  I am personally hoping for a moon return trajectory. Could the second stage do a moon trajectory as part of its relight testing on the upcoming flight etc?  Could it do some rentry / reuse testing of its own? Could it do a landing burn like stage 1?  Mightas well test relight capabilities while breaking records. Is it safe to say the hardest part of designing rockets is the systems engineering aspect (making sure everything is functioning together, eliminating weak points in the overall design, etc.), or are particular aspects of some subsystems like propulsion still particularly difficult?   What aspects of computer simulation (solving PDEs or other) are currently lagging in terms of being helpful with eliminating problems before the first prototype on rocket subsystems?  I know these are difficult questions I am basically asking what is the current bleeding edge of research in rocket technology. I am not really asking about stuff related to advanced propulsion for deep space missions looking at cost optimized ground to orbit rockets here. Mods, could we give flairs for everyone working at SpaceX? Lets talk about interstages.   Why do some rockets jettison them from both stages and others (like Falcon) leave them attached to the booster?  Also, watching some old Saturn 5 videos, why does it jettison the first stage, then drop the interstage like a minute later?  I can understand waiting until engine start, but why not right away? How many people are working on the hyperloop competition at SpaceX? Is anyone working full time on it? Has anyone been hire for it? In other words, how much effort does SpaceX put into it? Me and my girlfriend (living in Belgium) have a vacation to the States planned. We're leaving on a direct flight to Vegas on December 11th and are heading back home December 30th. I had the vacation pretty well planned out and a flight to Orlando will be expensive booking only two weeks in advance, but damnit I really want to see that launch. I'd have to cancel the pre-paid rental car and several hotel bookings, but I feel I will regret it if I don't. Any opinions? What is *beta angle cutout*? Sorta dumb retro-propulsion question...when stage does its boostback maneuver it\'s in zero G, do they use an ullage motor or just helium pressure in the tanks to keep the fuel where it needs to be?  Then follow on, once the stage is closer to landing and it starts it\'s ""oh crap slow down slow down"" burn, i assume it\'s the helium pressure alone that keeps the fuel at the bottom of the tank?  Is that right? I notice that when the OG2 launch date pushed back to the 15th, the SpaceX Stats announcement also moved to match the day before. Was that intentional?  Also, shouldn\'t the SpaceX Stats main page say ""launching december 2015"" instead of november? November is done. Has anyone collected data on times between a failure and RTF from various organizations and vehicles? Obviously six months is fast, but I'm curious by how much. Does anyone have any idea how active SpaceX Seattle is? I'm filming a documentary on aerospace and live up here in the PNW. I'll be heading down there to Aerojet Rocketdyne next week and thought maybe it might be possible to visit them and talk to someone at the same time, but that would be silly if nothing is going on there. Will the next Falcon landing attempt at Cape require two booster ~~flip~~ turn around maneuvers? Did reproducing the strut failure on ground involve baths of LOX or maybe liquid nitrogen as a safer alternative?  How much does the low temp affect the strength of the strut? Will the new version of Falcon 9 (not even going to try to get the name right :-) be able to land for all missions?  I seem to recall them saying anything too big for F9 to land with will go on Falcon Heavy.  But then Spaceflight bought a ride-share mission for which the total mass for the trajectory they want seems to exceed the capacity of F9R, but they are using F9.  Will the F9 be replaced with FH at SpaceX's discretion, if it is ready and proven? What is holding SpaceX back from officially declaring a RTF date? If 12/15 really does become their RTF date, it seems to me that they should have officially confirmed it by now. Orbital had their RTF date confirmed for a while before the actual day Everyone always says F9 is white to reflect sunlight and keep cool. If that's the case, why paint it at all? Why not keep it as shiny metal, which is naturally reflective? Maybe put a transparent coating on it for protection, but it doesn't seem like white paint would have an advantage over metal. How will the F9 full thrust engines on the next launch impact the hoverslam maneuver? The throttle range of the old engines were 70-100% which was already too much thrust to hover. If you look at BO's landing they hover for a sec to get the wobble stable before touching down, in contrast the F9 does a hoverslam which looks very sensitive to accuracy. Does anyone ever have any habbits during a launch that they find odd?  I always salute the rocket Right at liftoff,  I do this because I know there is no going back after the launch clamps are off. Last time I did it was I think The recent HII A launch for japan. I remember I saluted CRS-7 at liftoff expecting to see the booster back, but we all know what happend there...  I think I started this habit around CRS-5ish been doing it ever since another thing, I cannot do a Launch without some sort of drink I always need something carbonated whether it be diet coke or water. So there's this OA4 launch today to the ISS. Does anyone know where it's livestreamed? Will Elon make another AMA any soon? SpaceX's launch window for going to ISS is instantaneous. ULA's Atlas V has a launch window of 30 minutes to ISS. How do they manage that? Can Falcon 9 be improved to have wider launch windows and adjust for short delays? And if so, how? Do we have any indication what weather will look on December 15 at the Cape? Given the scrub of Atlas V today, I'm hoping we won't have to worry about this for RTF (assuming it actually happens on 12/15)...   (paging /u/cuweathernerd) How much do you think a relatively small landing pad had to contribute with failed landing attempts? Does anyone know if this is one of the reasons they want to try it on land? Also Is the landing pad at complex 13 even going to be larger than the barge? I've looked all around but can't seem to find anything on the matter... - any ideas or projects to deter/eliminate space debris like a sonic gun or a thermal (?) gun to disintegrate or repel debris before it gets too dangerously close to the space bases or anything important?  - do you notice a increased surge in funding/donations surrounding the filming and release of space related movies like Star Wars?  - does SpaceX 'outsource' to social media and ask for laypersons or hobbyists help for suggestions of possible answers to the difficult questions ?  - will spacex ever partner or work with blue origin ever.. or are they both just currently working on their separate projects for now? great work thanks :) When landing the first stage of Falcon 9, is it fully autonomous or is it controlled by ground? Any word whether flight 21 (OG2, aka the return to flight) will feature redesigned landing legs / airbrakes [as hinted in this tweet?]( What is the dry mass of the full-thrust falcon 9? From what distance would you theoretically able to see the launch? I know the profile for RTF is pretty straight up, and I have the tinyests of hopes of being able to spot the Falcon from Havana, Cuba. Any chance this might come true? Why is it so bad to call JRTI/OCISLY a barge? I always hear people saying ""BAHHHH Don\'t call it a barge! Call it ASDS!"" What time is it scheduled to launch in UK time? Might be at school and I don't want to miss this Not SpaceX related, but still about spaceflight.   I read a proposal a while back about doing a wet-lab with the SLS upper stage.  This seems almost too small to be useful.  Could SLS put its core into orbit with no upper stage or payload, for a giant wet lab? As a matter of interest, when are the mission patches released? And where could I get the OG2 patch when it's released? Hopefully I can get one to the UK... The bending of the booster can be seen clearly during the last landing attempt. I estimate a deflection of about 300mm at the centre. Can anyone make a better estimate, the video I am watching is quite fuzzy? Why does SpaceX ship boosters by truck, not by air?   Air seems faster, gentler, and safer.  Since up to three boosters can fit the aircraft that ULA uses, it may also be more economical.    ULA recently [moved an Atlas V booster]( from Huntsville AL to Vandenberg in CA by air.  Every F9 booster traverses from CA to McGregor TX to launch site ... and perhaps soon they will go back to Hawthorn CA for analysis or refurbishment.    From the article on ULA: ""The Atlas V and Delta IV boosters can be transported via the Delta Mariner,"" said Ghazali. ""This large ship is capable of carrying up to three boosters from the production site in Alabama to either Cape Canaveral Air Force Station or Vandenberg.""  ""Launch vehicle processing has very tight timelines,"" said Zarybnisky. ""Delays in a single operation can have large ripple effects across the process. By ensuring a smooth delivery, we can prevent schedule compression that induces additional risk into launch vehicle processing."" How does boostback to the launch pad work, reversing its trajectory seems MUCH more complicated than just a controlled fall out of the sky onto the ASDS.   Does it just burn ALOT longer after the turn at the apex, where aerodynics arent a big issue and essentially stop its ~mach 7 speed.... then do another turn and ride it home? Is SpaceX really going to launch two rockets a day after each other? (4th and 5th of January) That would be a first? What's the minimum pad turnaround time, particularly for rockets comparable to Falcon 9? As I understood it, Falcon 9 landings weren't streamed because it's out at sea with no good connection. Does this mean that there is a possibility that we get a live stream of the RTF landing on land? What's up with the special announcement? I don't hear anything about it, but I see the date keeps getting pushed back on the side bar So if they had originally planned to launch falcon heavy in August 15, why isn't LC-39A already completed? Does anyone know how long it takes the M1D to go from 0-100% throttle?  Source is a bonus, but I'm not too picky Probably a dumb question. I remembered reading that falcon 1 was the first private rocket to make it to orbit. However wouldn't that title belong to ULA? I believe that they put a rocket into orbit before spaceX did In the ISS flight plan [on page 10 this NASA .pdf]( Cygnus flights are planned to be berthed for 50-60 days, while dragon flights are only planned to be berthed for 30. Is there a technical reason for this? What springs to mind is that Cygnus has a massive volume (almost half as big as the ATV) and might take longer to unload. Musk has said that the MCT is going to be consist of a giant first stage booster and a second stage which is also going to be the capsule, and will carry about 100 people. But the thing is, putting 100 people on top of a giant dynamite isn't quite safe, so we need a super powerful launch escape system, which, if SpaceX continue to develop a HyperDraco, will also put the crew under the mercy of a ton of toxic hydraulic fuel (and an extra ton is gonna make the MCT *much* heavier, and in turn, less payloads to mars) . So in the end, is MCT still a feasible project? Does anyone have a velocity over altitude graph or dataset for a recent spacex or similiar rocket launch for the very first few seconds of liftoff say within 100 yards of the ground?   Wondering how long a rocket stays within potential tether range of the ground.  A tether similiar to the TOW missile tether. How does SpaceX or other modern rocket companies mitigate electrical static charges created during thrusting ala the flamejet generator effect?  If you dont know what a flamejet generator is    And it can be unintentional as well as intentional as with a Kelvin's Thunderstorm   voltage generator. Let's say sometime in the near future, the ISS de-orbits and China begin to build their own space station. Would SpaceX be allowed to help them as a commercial contractor? If not with construction, then with resupply missions? Orbital mechanics question here...  It was good fun watching the ULA/Orbital launch yesterday. Couple questions. First (not that important), the commentator kept mentioning the RL10 was running oxidizer rich. Was that a departure from normal?   Second (more important), When the broadcast switched to telemetry showing apogee and perigee i was shocked. The vehicle had an apogee in the 220+mile range and a perigee in the -1600 mile range (orbit that was achieved being 124 x 124 miles). As the burn continued the apogee continued to decrease while the perigee increased. It was rather interesting to see those numbers play out. It was apparent that the apogee was the crafts actual altitude and was on the decent while the little RL10 puffed away to raise the perigee before it ran out of altitude. Meco happened right at the designed orbit. I had always thought that the first stage set the apogee and the second stage achieved orbit at apogee, like KSP. So my question is, why do they do it this way? I assume it is the most efficient relating to getting the most performance out of the first stage. Second, Does Spacex follow the same trajectory with Dragon? Did the Dragon abort test have a mass simulator in the trunk or is it supposed to drop its payload in case of an abort? It seems reasonable that it would drop it's payload as it would be lost anyway in an abort, but I've never heard it discussed. The question I have is about LauncherOne and the newly announced Cosmic Girl mother ship. AFAIK, LauncherOne utilizes LOX and RP-1 for it\'s main engines for the first and second stages. [As far as I can tell from pictures, it looks like the Newton series engines are gas generator cycle engines]( and the attitude control will solely be done using thrust vectoring. So, there does not seem to be any vernier engines, meaning there\'s no other types of propellants, notably hypergolics. [NSF]( states that it will take approximately 30 minutes from takeoff to the ""drop zone"". I\'d figure taxiing and getting cleared for takeoff can add up 10-15 minutes from ""ready"" to drop and actual ignition of vehicle engines.  How are launch operations carried out specific to fueling the vehicle? Will a ground operator have to manually fuel the vehicle and detach the propellant lines prior to take off? Will the boil off from the LOX during the 30-45 minutes from fill up to ignition be significant enough? Is there reservoir of LOX onboard the mothership that will be used to continuously fuel the vehicle during ascent? How will safety of the operators and pilots be ensured during fueling? Won\'t more stringent certifications and testing similar to human rating the vehicle need to be done as there are human operators during the first phase of the mission? What are the contingency plans in case where an engine fails on the mothership? How easy will it to de-fuel in cases of emergency landings? Especially when landing in places without the fueling infrastructure?    Previous air launched vehicles didn\'t have these issues as they utilized solid propellant systems. Why are the engine tests at McGregor so late at night? /u/spacecadet_88 [reported]( that they'll test them at around 10pm. Is there a technical reason to test so late? In my country this wouldn't be permitted so I figured they'd have to have a solid reason to make that much noise late at night. What's the launch window for Orbcomm December 19th? I'm having a party and thinking of hosting a watching when it happens (I was here for helium-gate '14, so I know there might be a scrub). What happened to the special announcement that was on the sidebar? There used to be a date on the ""Select Upcoming Events"" that kept being continually pushed back (the latest I saw was Dec 18). Where did that go? I\'d like to know how SpaceX stores and supplies the fuels for the Dragon thrusters. In other posts I\'ve read bladders and PMDs (propellant mgmt devices) mentioned as well as thruster firings to ""settle"" the fuel. Does anyone know for sure what the actual method is?  The real discriminator for me is reusable versus disposable (Dragon versus CST100). Since CST100 does not return its propulsion module, how will Boeing be able to compete on price if they don\'t reuse tanks and thrusters? Both of these must be very expensive. By the way, I\'ve heard the word ""bladder"" used in two ways for prop tanks. One is a flexible elastomeric ""diaphragm"" such as that found in Soyuz. (I believe this is the life limiting item that forces the Soyuz to return to earth in 6 or 9 months.) The second are metallic diaphragms which have unlimited life, but are not reusable. These don\'t seem likely for Dragon, but might explain why Boeing\'s service module is jettisoned prior to reentry? Would Spacex find it helpful to use the Stennis A-3 test stand? It can handle up to 1 mlbf, simulate high altitudes, and currently is unused. It would need some refurbishment and retrofitting for Raptor, but that shouldn't be to difficult. I have been watching the cygnus mission and the orbital mechanics part has really facinated me. Ula got cygnus to a 124mile circular orbit inclined 51.6 degrees which was a bullseye. Now cygnus has docked with the iss at approx 250 miles in altitude. I read that cygnus has changed its dv by aprox 100m/s. Does 100m/s equal over 100miles in orbital altitude? Anyone know how the Orbcomm OG2 satellites separate from the Moog dispenser? Explosive bolts? I was watching the [video of F9R]( and I noticed that the rocket came to a stop at the apex of its flight. I thought that the first stage of Falcon 9 had a TWR &gt; 1 when landing, hence the need for a hover-slam, so how is it able to do this? Is it using a modified Merlin engine, or just weighted to decrease the TWR? Falcon 9 is designed to land nearly empty. Are its legs only made to handle its empty weight, or would a 1st stage be able to stand up even when full of fuel?  Follow-up: If the legs are able to hold up the full tank, are the leg actuators able to *lift* the first stage? Could it go up on legs while on the pad, if it wanted to? Might be a silly question, but once Boca Chica is up an launching, do you think launches would be visible from Florida's west coast? Maybe only night time launches? A few minutes after launch once it comes over the horizon perhaps? Been out of the loop while SpaceX has been grounded for the last while, and forgive me for my ignorance but...  Is the launch schedule in the sidebar for the next month for real?! 4 launches in the span of 3 weeks, and two of them only a day apart?! How???  Doesn't it take a ton of resources and days of preparation to setup a launch for which the window of opportunity is highly volatile? There have been cases where launches were delayed or scrubbed a couple days in the past right? Wouldn't that have a high probability of conflicting with the other launch? I would have assumed they'd using a different launch site but according to the subreddit wiki's launch manifest (which needs updating) they're both going from Cape Canaveral. When doing a static/test fire at the cape, do they fully fuel the first stage, or just put in enough for the test fire? I presume they don't fuel the second stage at all. Just wondering as doing a full fuel/defuel may show up any problems in those systems that could cause  a delay on launch day. slightly open-ended question here, but let's assume that the payload cost to Low Earth Orbit drops to $100 per kilo. With that assumption, how much would it cost to put 1 kilo (intact!) on the surface of Mars? The deltaV from LEO to Mars is about 3.6km/sec if you use every possible aerobrake, which gives a mass ratio around 3 or 4. So the answer is *at least* $400/kilo to Mars. In reality it would be higher, but how much?  Additional question: how can that gap be made smaller? For $500/kilo to Mars Surface, you can easily send a small rover for chump change. Mars could be covered with many such rovers messing around and testing technology. You could send automated rocket fuel manufacturies and check that that worked. How does the Merlin vacuum engine ignite itself? I haven't been able to find much on that, but I'm really curious This is a rather ignorant question about electronics coming from a mechanical engineering student.   In a selector voter scheme, how is the validity and functionality of the multiplexers and selector verified during operation? While the sensor/computer output validity is accounted that that scheme, it assumes that the selecting circuit and multiplexers are correct. I guess the question is asking: who governs the governors? The multiplexer can be a simple relay/transistor that takes inputs from a primary and back up sensor output and switches to the backup once a fault is observed. Realistically, I suppose they won't fail unless there's a physical failure of the system. But how is the output of the voter circuit validated in real time? Another layer of selector voter? Or is it assumed to be robust since it can be made with discrete op amps, and other components? I'll be interning in Avionics Manufacturing at SpaceX this summer. I'm psyched but anxious that I know little about avionics or manufacturing. Any suggested books or sites I can use to get to learn some principles of avionics and of manufacturing, and maybe even of avionics manufacturing? What would a second launch failure on the 19th of December mean for SpaceX (and the industry)? How many hypothetical launch failures could SpaceX financially absorb before bankruptcy? Has anyone figured the odds on complete retrieval? How much time does SpaceX need to make launchpad ready for another launch? I know the new renders show the rockets with the landing legs in black, but the original concept had the interstage in black, and it turned out to be all white. Does anyone have any info on whether the legs will actually be black? Just a small detail but I'm curious nonetheless. Do we have any info on SHERPA? Also, how good is SLC-4 to watch? I'm thinking about getting a couple guys together and driving down to see the next Vandy launch after Jason-3 Which is more exciting; Star Wars opening on the 18th, or the real deal star wars on the 19th? Will SES-9 launch to 1,800m/s GTO?  Is SES-9 5,300kg? Will F9 first stage attempt a barge landing?  If yes, then that is great! In the recent GQ article, Elon states that the moniker BFR was his idea. I had always assumed that it was coined on this sub-reddit. Anyone know when it first appeared on r/spacex, and the story behind how it made it here - ie did Elon ever mention it in any of his speeches or media events, or did it get here by some other means? I will be in San Francisco on Jan 17.  Not sure if I will have a means of transportation... Do you think I will be able to see Jason-3 launch from that far? Hi, been searching around for SpaceX wallpapers. All of them seem to be for a single screen though. Does anyone have a collection of wallpapers for dual-screens? How long will it take for the first stage to return to launch pad (well, landing zone) after stage separation? Is there an easy approximation for adding gravity losses to the rocket equation? Otherwise what is the path a Falcon 9 would take, roughly, for a satellite launch from Florida. Is it even logistically possible for us, as of right now, to support 100's of people on Mars? (Assuming we already have the MCT). Will any Mars base capable of supporting so many people not be a massive project of a scale never before seen? It would take dozens of launches to even create an area large enough to comfortably support the crew. To my understanding (as answered in another comment here) , the Falcon 9 is completely assembled and the first stage fully loaded with propellant during static fire. But what if something goes really wrong during the test and the payload is damaged? Are there any security measures to prevent that from happening? Boostback and reentry burn are each 3 engines. Are they the same 3? Which ones? What are the odds of SpaceXStats being back before RTF? With the new leak of some numbers proposed around BFR. What are the logistical implications? How on earth would you transport such a behemoth between construction facilities and launch sites? Will SpaceX have to create a new factory with its own port to be able to ship the parts to the Cape? Will the first stage be monolithic or assembled at the launch site? Where is the best place for me to watch the landing attempt? I'll be there to watch the launch, should I stay where I am? Move somewhere else?  *If they get land landing clearance. Do we know what the relight mechanism for Merlin is/where it happens? Injector? Combustion chamber? I'm thinking of the shots of the Shuttle launches with sparks flying under the engine bells, and figuring it's probably not like that, given the lack of external spark-shooters above the Karman line. I'm guessing it's a spark plug somewhere, but just curious!  *Not sure if this has been asked/answered before; I couldn't find it in a quick Google search. What brought the BFR to the front of everybodys minds all of a sudden?  It's fun to read about (I had never heard of it) and suddenly there are a bunch of posts about it? When does Dragon get fueled?  On the pad, in the hanger, or earlier?  It seems on the pad would require more service hardware, but rollout and erecting a fueled dragon would be more dangerous. As cis-lunar space becomes saturated with robotic telepresence and as thousands of settlers travel to Mars every two years...why will taxpayers need human astronauts? (Trying to be provocative...but curious, thanks.) With the on-going development of the Raptor engine, I wonder if Spacex is planning a new rocket (or possibly a new second stage, or both) using it, before the BFR / MCT. It would make sense to use it and get some flight time, so it will be a known commodity when they finally get around to building the BFR. Anyone know how many Raptors it would take to equal the thrust of the current 9 Merlin FT engines being used? (based on the last performance specs provided by Elon in his AMA). I just checked the SpaceX website, and it says that they schedualed a static fire of the falcon 9 rocket. I'm pretty sure that other falcon 9 rockets have been used before. Is SpaceX using a different engine for the Orbcomm 2 mission, or do they do a static test before using any rocket? In the launch webcasts, they always switch to a CGI view once the second stage + payload gets beyond camera visual range. Why does this render looks so horrible? Flat textures, low resolutions, no lighting calculations, etc. Even Kerbal Space Program looks better than what this super high-tech company puts out. Why are their animation capabilities so limited? What do we know, or what information was 'leaked' about the BFR. All I've seen is people talking about it. Why are there no existing methalox engines?  Aside from Elon putting his stamp on the idea, has something changed technologically or economically that makes methane feasible when it wasn't before? Musk has stated he wants to send huge numbers of people to Mars using the BFR/MCT. What will be the qualifications and characteristics of the initial people he sends? Existing astronauts have mostly been scientists with a variety of backgrounds, some with experience flying fast jets - is it likely this will also be true of the first people SpaceX sends to establish the colony? Lots of engineers and math/physics literate people on here - which is great. I'm a SpaceX / Elon Musk fan who makes a living as a lawyer, and I'm interested in discussing the societal, governance and legal structure of a Martian colony - Democracy 2.0 as Elon has called it. Does anyone know of an online forum or group that focuses on these topics? When will the launch thread be posted? Do they do the F9 the day of the static fire or the day before?",557,,0

Almost without error. Great article, lots of new information about the landing and what will happen if it's successful. Am I the only one that finds it sort of disappointing that they\'re practically gimping the first stage to get it back? Like ""16 miles downrange from the launch site"", is not very far. It\'s a fraction of an expendable launch, and it\'s almost like they\'re making S1 act as ""S0.75"".   I guess you could call it trajectory optimization or w/e though. &gt; The FAA concluded an environmental review earlier this month for SpaceX to start landing boosters at LZ-1, known as the Finding of No Significant Impact [(FONSI)](  As /u/EchoLogic says,   &gt; ""16 miles downrange from the launch site"", is not very far.  That\'s a hair under 30km - not very far indeed. However, the source document for that figure that they link also says:  &gt; Currently, the Falcon 9 first stage drops by parachute approximately 500 nautical miles downrange into the Atlantic Ocean, east of and well beyond the east coast of Florida, and is recovered by a salvage ship that, during a launch, is stationed in a Range Safety-designated safe zone near the anticipated area of splash-down.  Which... um... what?  So I\'d take that first-stage downrange figure with a grain of salt. I mean, if the landing is occurring at ~L+10, then the rocket would need to be going almost directly upwards for that downrange distance, wouldn\'t it?  The OG2 constellation orbits at about 700km, which doesn\'t sound to me like it would necessitate such an upright course. ""More than three decades passed before SpaceX leased it last February, and efforts to construct **five landing pads** for its returning Falcon-9 first-stage hardware soon got underway.""  Now why 5 pads? I can see 3 for a heavy but why would you need 5 on a given site? ###&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009;  Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations and contractions I've seen in this thread:  |Contraction|Expansion| |-------|---------| |BFR|Big ~~Fu-~~ *Falcon* Rocket| |CRS|[Commercial Resupply Services contract with NASA](| | |Communications Relay Satellite| |FAA|Federal Aviation Administration| |GTO|[Geostationary Transfer Orbit](| |LZ|Landing Zone| |MECO|Main Engine Cut-Off| |MEO|Mid Earth Orbit (2000-35780km)| |OG2|Orbcomm's Generation 2 satellite network, to be launched by SpaceX| |RTF|Return to Flight| |SES|Formerly Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; Europ&amp;eacute;enne des Satellites, a major SpaceX customer| |TWR|Thrust-to-Weight Ratio|  ---------------- ^(*Note: Replies to this comment will be deleted.*)   *^See ^[/r/spacex/wiki/acronyms]( ^(*for a full list of acronyms with explanations.*)   ^(I'm a bot; I first read this thread at 07:27 UTC on 20th Dec 2015. www.decronym.xyz for a list of subs where I'm active; if I'm acting up, message )^[OrangeredStilton]( How much of a factor will excess fuel be in the first stage with the 1.2?

I can\'t even get my head around someone who can be so measured and calm mere moments before possibly seeing his dream live or die.  There\'s been a lot of debate here and elsewhere in the last few months about what a failure at this point could mean for SpaceX. Agreement has ranged between a pretty big setback to The End. There\'s been a million discussions about what could go wrong, a myriad of things that could go wrong in a normal rocket launch combined with the myriad of things that could go wrong after separation and S1 became it\'s own separate entity with it\'s own individual mission. There\'s been discussion and debate over what various failure modes could mean for the concept of reusability.  There\'s been a near infinite number of naysayers and detractors. From Jim on NSF to the randos that sometimes come here to talk shit, to the idiots on the SpaceX Facebook group talking about how the engineers are misguided, to industry professionals who through a combination of fear and unwillingness/inability to look forward have said this can never happen.  Tonight we have seen an unqualified success. There is nothing to point to and say ""but...""   Technically tonight is meaningless, landing a booster is a very expensive way to set a record that people all over the internet are arguing about already. We\'re just a hair closer to reusability than we were yesterday; after all a landed booster is only reusable if it lifts off again.   That said I suspect that December 21st, 2015 is a day that will forever be written in history. Today it is but a small step toward the future, but the history books may well write it as a giant leap for the survivability and progress of mankind. If reusability is possible tonight is our first step toward it. If low cost access to space is a reality tonight is our first step toward it. If humans can ever become a multiplanetary organism tonight is our first step toward it. If mankind is to continue our natural desire to explore ever further and every more harsh terrains tonight is our first step toward it. If the history books write what we hope they\'ll write far into the future tonight is going to be a singular point in time where people can point to and say ""that\'s where it started.""  Tonight we celebrate. All of the employees that have sacrificed so much to make this possible. Elon and Shotwell. Fans of space everywhere.

Maybe we can learn something about the first stage dry mass! gorgeous!!!!! Anyone as surprised as I am about all the dirt (soot?) that accumulated, except on the middle section? Wow there's a press boat now, I guess they really want to show off this baby. Looks like they have craned it on top of some stand and are ready to fold the legs. Yo, a request if possible; any horizontal pics? So that it can fit nicely as background. :) Any idea what the equipment is around it?    Is the big tank for draining the remaining RP-1 into? Awesome shot! Thanks Jared! Sad I\'m not there :/   Can we take a moment to marvel at the engineering of those legs! How on earth does such a long ""pole"" come from such a small place?! Why does it need a crane? This is such an amazing picture, thanks for sharing.  Also I'm glad we keep getting new pictures because I woke up this morning a little bit worried I had dreamed the whole thing after I fell into a shock induced coma shortly after a spectacular failure.

Took me a while to notice it is off the ground in this picture.  Check out the foot of the landing leg- it's in the air! Can anyone tell me what the vertical somewhat jagged line is that runs up the side of the booster under the area protected by the leg? Initially i am thinking it is a cable or crack... but cable actually doesn't make a ton of sense as it is not protected very well. I am simply stunned by the size of the first stage! Having those cranes next to it really puts the dimensions into perspective. You can read the stats, but it doesn't really sink in until you see it like that. There are what look like LOX or helium tanks, and a propane tank...?  Any chance SpaceX is laying the groundwork for the booster to fly back to Texas by itself? Let\'s hope they\'ll release some time-lapse power-washing ""porn"" in the near future. =P Do they make cranes big enough for, say, a BFR?  And if landing becomes more commonplace there, any chance they'd make some sort of permanent erector-device maybe to take its place?  It just seems a little hokey, really, to have to wheel in some rented crane every time you want to park your rocket. Ah ha. All those '50's SciFi space rocket movies where they land with their engines suddenly don't seem so fake now, do they? Are there any photos showing how close it got to a bullseye on the pad? This a great picture, helps you realize the real scale of the beast. It's like landing a fucking building. Why is some part of the stage 1 remain white, while other part are either cover with ash, or paint came off?  Why is the white and grey such a clean line as opposed to a fade out color? The finally figured out that it will work way more reliably on solid land. Not a barge moving on three axis. Holy shit it's enormous. I thought it was way smaller than this. Here\'s a ""before &amp; after"" comparison photo: Amazing photo and achievement. Have we got any idea what happens next? This one will obviously get torn down and analysed in detail. But if they keep landing them, cores are soon going to start piling up. Do we know if they plan to launch one with like a dummie payload on, or what? I was bombarded by all the posts in the morning. I thought it was neat, but not blown away.   Now I see the size of it.   I, I uh, I don't have words to do it justice. Now with the crane for size comparison it seems the booster is a whole lot bigger than I anticipated. So do they plan to use this stage again, or was this landing just a proof of concept and they'll reuse the next one they launch? Didn't realize it was so huge. wow now im even more impressed! had no clue how absolutely huge this thing is! Now that they got the 1st stage back at LZ-1 (yah!), how do they proceed?  I assume the crane is there to steady it if the wind gets up whilst any remaining fuel/LOX/etc is vented/detanked.  Is the plan to then bring a strongback over to LZ-1, attach this stage to it and then drop it to the horizontal?  How long will that take? The dude in the orange reflective vest and white hardhat really drives home just how huge the 1st stage is...  o.o   o.0   0.o   \\&gt;.&lt;   O.O They should have landed directly on that crane! Then they wouldn't need those pesky landing legs! Well, it's hanging not standing, but I get the gist. Is it covered in soot? ...and if we rewind a little to September 28, 2012:   - Grashopper did its first 6 foot hop.",561,You mean HANGING proud? The legs clearly are above ground.,0

I don't really see how stressful follows necessarily from meaningful, but his opinion on it does explain the average employee's take on working for one of his companies. These are two very interesting issues related to choosing and configuring work:   * the degree to which it produces something that you, as a worker, see as meaningful; and * the amount of hours you spend doing it.  No doubt for those of us who are minded of technology, the environment, design, morality, and exploration - working for SpaceX or Tesla would be to contribute to something very inspiring.  But I can't help wonder if Musk's requirement, for himself and others, to work long hours might not be sustainable over the long term. He may risk burning people out who otherwise are highly motivated. He may risk quality control, when sleepy people miss critical but subtle problems.

I don't like most of the armchair designers' attempts at redesigning the front, but that one is alright. I'm not sure which I'd prefer (and I already liked the original design). It looks good, it also screams Ferrari. I love James design I know I might not be the majority but I'm partial to von Holzhausen's design - purely because it reminds me of an Aston and I've always been in love with them... Honestly I think the best nose is in Franz's sketch. It looks slightly different and beautifully proportioned. i like the flattened look, it makes the car stand out I like Franz's design more.   just wish he would move the 'T' down Looks like Elon Musk has seen this. I much prefer this.  The diagonal ridges on the original frame the front, but there's nothing there so it looks like something's missing. Do americans not have license plates in front? This design change totally ignores that fact. I like the Anders nose better. Electric cars dont need a grill but the car appears to be missing things. My brain is having a hard time looking at the model 3 because of that- it feels like something is wrong/missing. Just give me whichever one has the better drag coefficient. I prefer the original. It is distinctive: you can't look at the car and confuse it with anything else. The suggested alteration makes it look like a Porsche. It looks beautiful and unique as it is. I hope they keep it. The real one has grown on me for sure.  Maybe save picture one for the inevitable coupe version. :) This one works better, more in line with Model X No way man. The original nose from the reveal is distinct , futuristic, and beautiful. This just looks like blah Personally I think something as simple moving the Tesla badge up to the front(like in the model s or x) would help break up the front a bit. Im scared they are going to change it too much, I love it so much the way it is. It really grows on you... The current design as shown in the unveiling has really grown on me. I hope they don't change it much if at all I\'m guessing that the people that shit in the ""fake"" grill of the  model S would view the Anders version more favorably. I think the Anders looks better, also seems more aerodynamic. The problem is you need the forward facing Antenna and sensors.   Harder to do on the curved nose design.  This. Design also doesn't drive air into the drive.train.  You still need airflow for cooling and AC.  This proposed change would have air move to the side,  rather than under the vehicle where it is needed. Kind of like the Panamera Only thing that's stopping me from pre-ordering is the lack of HUD and that weird duckbill nose. I like them both. Just my personal taste, but I like the flat nose better. The sports car look has always been a turn off for me. I like muscle cars and pimpmobiles. So never mind me.",223,Just goes from looking like a Panamera to looking like a Corvette. I much prefer the OG design. Who is James Anders and what's his claim to fame? No I don't like his concept--it looks like grandpa's mouth without false teeth. Leave the Model 3 alone!,1

The tint in my Model S is great though. There isn't a dynamic range of tint. If you are worried about heat the glass is laminated and is quite thermally manageable. There aren't any widespread complaints about the greenhouse effect in either the S or X (and I don't say there are NONE only because if I do I am sure someone will complain, it is not a known problem). If you don't like the all-glass roof, they have said a metal roof option and a sunroof option will be available as well. Although they haven't confirmed anything I suspect you will get slightly less headroom in a metal roof version much like the pano roof versus solid roof in the S.   One rider at the event asked if the glass will get more tinting than what the reveal models had and the Tesla rep said most likely since the glass was clear at the reveal.  Basically if you are 6'+ or chauffeur basketball players around you should stick with the glass roof. The driver videos talked about it having UV absorption and reflection like the model X windshield has. So I doubt its a normal tint like we think of it now. I had Smart Tint on all my cars in Arizona. Once the power goes off, the tint goes opaque. While the car is on, I could adjust how dark I wanted the tint to be. Darker during the day, lighter at night.   If I buy the one with the glass roof, and the car gets too hot in the summer, I'm going to have that installed on the roof. Actually, I was worried about the opposite :-)  I'm not worried about the roof not being dark enough, I'm worried about it being too dark.  I read about all the UV blocking stuff, and I read what everyone things about the glass roof on the S, I'm thinking I would like little to no tint on the roof.",7,,0

I'm sure a longer FH fairing would also be plausible... if comsat launches were actually volume rather than mass limited! so, at best, it would be competitive with F9 if it would be flying this days.  By next year (without beginning to fly) those prices would look expensive compared to reused F9's and the payload capability will be small compared to FH.  By the time it starts flying I hope they can keep all their government contracts, because commercially, at those prices, they're designing something already obsolete.  Rather hope that major design changes are on their way (from their original Ariane 6 designs) and they can improve much more the mass and price.

Glad to see competition is picking up. I'm sure the Falcon 9 will be cheaper by then though... We will see.  The Ariane 5 main components are built by ~10 companies in just as many countries. These are large companies and all of them want to make a profit. Everybody can imagine the overhead costs that SpaceX simply does not have at all, thanks to building all core components in-house.  ESA has subsidized Ariane 5 launch prices heavily for many years under the EGAS program, when this ran out launch price rose 50%. Maybe they are planning something similar for Ariane 6. ....annd then Falcon heavy comes along... ....annd then F9 becomes reusable.... This makes no sense to me. Most LEO and GTO payloads are in the F9FT range, and ride solo. Clearly they have no competition for the F9FT, which can throw 5000kg to GTO. Maybe they want to be more competitive with FH for the few larger payloads that need more. And the FH does not need dual manifest. Yay for competition!!!!! :D The stare finally returned after five days... Are we talking &lt; 2X the $40M reused F9? Something tells me we aren't. By the time Ariane 6 is flying, that is what they will have to compete with. This assumes they hit their cost goals, and it's still years away from fruition. I commend them for trying to innovate but this seems like too little too late. They're using all their effort to catch up to a moving target that will be that much farther along by the time they're done. It sounds like a doomed strategy. This is what ESA has to say so that their own people will allow them to build another rocket. Now, it would be interesting to see if they can do it, since they are a multinational government project and they have all of the problems of government projects combined with the relationship management between member nations. U.S. states each vie for a portion of the pork barrel, but don't have the degree of sovereignty fhat European nations have nor the political power. The political pressure upon ESA to farm out major subsystems to multiple contractors in each of the member nations will be intense. One thing SpaceX (and other vendors like Scaled before them) made clear is that such diverse manufacturing is not the way to make it inexpensively. So, ESA will end up justifying this on national security and European sovereignty rather than cost. We shall see. I guess the customers are the real winners here... Heating up innovation in space was part of the goal when SpaceX was founded. So they're saying economies of scale works? Thanks Captain Obvious Which is great if you need more than Falcon can lift. If you don't, it's just 2x the price. Before or after the ESA funds half the price of it? Or are they not doing that anymore? Copied in from [reddit Ariane 6](  Just to put Ariane 6 cost into perspective with Vulcan and Falcon 9 (for commercial market GEO satellites).  - Vulcan is supposed to fly from 2019 and the target cost of low end rocket is $100mil (once Atlas and Delta are retired in 2020s?). The payload and cost will vary in wide range depending on how many SRBs (up to 6). The payload will be similar to Atlas V and less than Delta Heavy. From 2023 new ACES upper stage should be available increasing payload above Delta Heavy at the same cost.  - Atlas V will probably continue flying into 2020s until Vulcan is certified. It costs around $160mil. It is unclear whether ULA is able to decrease it's cost while Delta is in operation and Vulcan is being developed (Delta heavy will fly till Vulcan is operational and certified for the heaviest launches). ULA might once again fly three different rockets at the same time.  - Falcon 9 cost is $61mil with enough performance to loft most satellites. Re-used Falcon 9 will costs about $40mil. Falcon 9H will cost $90mil for trajectories allowing re-usability and is able to loft also most heavy satellites.  - Ariane 62 will loft average satellite for $76mil after 2020  - Ariane 64 will loft two average satellites for $126mil after 2020  - Ariane 5 usually launches two satellites in one go (one average and one bigger) for $137mil. The cheaper one is at price set to compete with Falcon9 at $60mil.",352,Its just too bad that the Ariane 6 is still just a drawing and will cost 3.5 billion dollars R &amp; D? You have to wonder what all that money gets spent on. A6 is pretty much a glorified fire work. Its first and second stages comprised entirely of solid rockets. The first Falcon 9 although significantly smaller was more complex and only cost apx 300 million to develop. About a 12th the cost. I think Ariane is kind of screwed to be honest.,0

I didn't know that the sample return is still on the table. I doubt it's related, but I was internship hunting and [this one]( came up a few weeks ago, that would be some interesting work! I think there's high possibility that science payload on the 2018 Red Dragon will be simple sample collecting system and sample return rocket.  We wouldn't have much choice in choosing which sample to be collected with just a robotic arm, but demoing the actual sample return system will change everything about future Martian surface robotic exploration.  There are some criticisms that the 2020 rover has sample canister but NASA currently don't have any plan on how to return that canister to Earth.  If SpaceX could prove that they can reliably (and preferably cheaply) return Martian samples back to Earth, future robotic exploration missions can be designed to focus more on choosing promising samples rather than being miniaturized laboratories. The idea of a lander just reaching an arm out and scooping up a sample is really stupid.  That's nothing but a propaganda victory.  The odds of getting an interesting sample is miniscule.   They need a Rover that collects samples to bring back to the transfer vehicle. ###&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009;  Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, contractions, and other phrases which expand to something larger, that I\'ve seen in this thread:  |Fewer Letters|More Letters| |-------|---------| |[BFR](/r/SpaceX/comments/4gqgty//d2kbbvo ""Used in this comment"")|Big ~~Fu-~~ *Falcon* Rocket| |[JPL](/r/SpaceX/comments/4gqgty//d2mskfn ""Used in this comment"")|Jet Propulsion Lab, Pasadena, California| |[JSC](/r/SpaceX/comments/4gqgty//d2k8rs5 ""Used in this comment"")|Johnson Space Center, Houston| |[KSC](/r/SpaceX/comments/4gqgty//d2k5i2v ""Used in this comment"")|Kennedy Space Center, Florida| |[MAV](/r/SpaceX/comments/4gqgty//d2msbqq ""Used in this comment"")|*Mars Ascent Vehicle* (possibly fictional)| |[MCT](/r/SpaceX/comments/4gqgty//d2kbbvo ""Used in this comment"")|Mars Colonial Transporter| |[MSFC](/r/SpaceX/comments/4gqgty//d2k8r39 ""Used in this comment"")|Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama|  ---------------- ^(*Decronym is a community product of /r/SpaceX, implemented* )[*^by ^request*](   ^(I\'m a bot, and I first saw this thread at 1st May 2016, 15:13 UTC.)

[^\\[Acronym ^lists\\]]( [^\\[Contact ^creator\\]]( [^\\[PHP ^source ^code\\]]( Are the access panels above the ocatweb/engines and between the lower leg mounts removed? Perhaps they are going to offload the remaining TEA-TEB at sea? Interesting that they already have the engine access covers off... Two questions for the knowledgeable:  What's up with that distinct 'high water level' carbon build up threshold above the landing legs? Temperature differences between fuel tanks affecting carbon buildup?  Considering that these are being reused, and suspecting that cleaning the soot buildup is a pain, and repainting is probably heavy, why paint the lower section white instead of black? Interesting that they showed different cameras during the landing between the two broadcasts. The technical webcast was a bit more dramatic and even had a crew member say ""we lost it"" before the camera switched over to the drone ship. Although I\'m guessing the comment was in regards to LoS communication with the first stage but that call came at a bad moment lol This may be a silly question, but why is the soot so dense and then just stop 1/3 of the way up the rocket? Doesn't look too much worse than the last two, despite the high-energy descent. This bodes well for future missions, I'd say! It looks to me like the grid fins have caught more soot this time. Maybe it's just the angle. Is that sea water or fresh water? I mean, I suppose the water on the deck comes from the water canons, but I wonder if it's salty or fresh. It looks like there's some rust-colored stuff above one of the grid fins that I don't remember from CRS-8... and it also looks browner at the bottom of the rocket... I wonder if that is the result of the more extreme heating of re-entry. Do you think they will release some landing footage? CRS-8 Top :   JCSAT-14 Top :   CRS-8 Bottom :   JCSAT-14 Bottom : Can someone explain the dark streaks/soot on the outside of the stage? I'm assuming some of the heating from re-entry and whatnot, but why is there such a clear, crisp line above the SpaceX logo? I assumed it would be a uniform distribution of the soot (or whatever it is). Is there a different type of paint used above and below it? The boundary for the soot on the oxygen tank above the bulkhead looks different from previous landings. Could the diagonal boundary be indicative of the stage's attitude during the reentry burn? Think we'll see it in the port by Sunday night? Why is the bottom 1/3 grey but the rest is mostly white with just scorch marks? I know it launches all white, but how is the line so perfect? So what is the logic for three engines (besides the obvious 2 is not enough and 4 is too many)?  The only way to have a symmetric arrangement is to have a row of three across the center.  It seems like 4 would make more sense since they could distributed in a square around the base.  I guess with the gimbaling it doesn't matter? So, SpaceX is now at 50% for landing boosters flown from the cape.  Can we say the system is operational now? K thx I have a soot question:  instead of making the tanks over and under each other, what if both tanks were the full height of the booster.  One would have a donut shaped profile and the other would be contained within the center.  I'm thinking if they did that, the outer tank would be the super chilled LOX tank and then the soot would a  have a consisten gradient from top to bottom. Is there a source for high res versions of these images? I wanted to get the opinions from the DragonRiders here. From my observations, the dark brown spots I have circled in the imgur album appear to be burn scars from the second stage ignition. From the other two landed F9 cores I have not seen this amount of scarring. Is it too early to tell if this is substantial damage to the booster or if its simply a superficial artifact from flight? If any of you have any input I would like to discuss it. Memo from SpaceX Marketing Dept.

Only thing glaring is the burn times (closer to 20s reentry).  I do wonder how feasible this system is. Has it been tested or is it another paper theory that may not work?  Edit: another thought. If this worked, it would limit downrange quite a bit I would think. Constant decel. As I understand it the supersonic retropropulsion generates a similar shroud of ionised gas i.e. the rocket exhaust. It would be interesting to compare the performance of the two techniques.  Edit: for reference here's You Tube for [NASA Red Mars proposal]( which requires hypersonic retropropulsion (description starts around 34m 12s). Would the massive magnetic fields interfere with any other signals in the Earth system? Variable output eh? Full power to the deflector shields! &gt;  I have no idea the residual fuel mass is for the reentry burns. The 1st stage fuel/ox mass is 396 MT. Lets assume that there's 10% of that fuel remaining at MECO. That translates to a 1st stage mass of 60MT, coincidentally identical to that baseline study.   The Falcon-9 FT propellant mass is [409.5 MT according to this link](  We can work back fuel margins based on re-entry and landing burn times: for example the JCSAT mission had a re-entry burn time of 18 seconds, and a landing burn time of 10 seconds. That's ~28 seconds of 3-engine burn. Fuel mass flow rate is 0.26 MT/sec per engine - so total fuel consumed during landing (assuming 100% thrust) is ~22 MT.  So total first stage mass should be around 47 MT - more than 10 MT less than your figure.  RTLS missions will have a much higher fuel margin, because they also perform boostback burns. Another thing I have not seen in the study is the mass consideration of lightweight heat shield types, like PICA and SpaceX's PICA-X enhancement of it. It is very interesting but there is a few problems. Even though it is a very promising technology it is not here yet and not well tested. SpaceX uses rocket technology from the 60's, electronics from modern retail stores and development techniques from software development. This is why we have NASA, to test out new technology and find out if and how they work so that we can take advantage of them.  Secondly the fuel required for the reentry burn is available for launch in case of failures. If they lost an engine during ascent they will need more fuel then planned to conduct the primary mission. Those fuel reserves need to be there if you are using the engines to land or not. Cutting 7 T of fuel from the reserves might reduce the safety margins too much. &gt; In my post, there was some speculation about the relevance of this technology to Red Dragon. The general conclusion was that is would significantly improve Red Dragon capability - decreasing the amount or retropropulsive fuel mass, increasing landed mass and allowing the trunk to be retained in stable Mars orbit as a bonus satellite. The only downside that I could see was that this technology isn't sufficiently tested to use on Red Dragon.  Hm, but AFAIK the Dragon does not use any retropropulsion: it uses PICA-X, a lightweight ablative heat shield to kill most of its entry speed, and then uses ordinary propulsion to kill the final ~500 m/sec and land on Mars. I'm not quite certain how to properly visually imagine such a reentry system. Would it visually look somewhat like the [Icarus Landing System from Deus Ex: Human Revolution]( Definitely not a rocket scientist - but my question is this:   Lets say that all of the above works out and effectively cancels the need for a re-entry burn.  INSTEAD of reducing S1 fuel mass and increasing payload to orbit - could we not instead use the previously reserved fuel mass and do a boostback burn achieving either a full RTLS, or a droneship landing much closer to the coast?  Thus eliminating downrange landing requirement, or at least reducing the time to/from the DPL location? &gt; ...That implies that the reentry burn is roughly 600 m/s.  &gt; In other words, adding a 700 kg magnetic braking system to the 1st stage, we should be able to eliminate about half of the reentry burn. I don't know the fuel mass that is equivalent to but it's certainly more than 700 kg.  Well, F9 FT has a thrust of 7,607 kN, and an Isp of 311 s. If 3/9 engines are lit, that's 1/3 the thrust. They could be throttling them down further, but then it would make sense to only light one engine. (Correct me if I'm wrong about any of this, and I'll update the estimate.) F=g0 * Isp * dm/dt, so solving for the mass flow rate we get  &gt; (7,607,000 kg*m/s^2 ) / (3 * 9.8 m/s^2 * 311 s) = ~832 kg/s  And the [latest entry burn]( lasts 18 seconds by my count. That implies roughly 15 tonnes of propellant, although if the engines are throttled down to 39% they would only consume ~6 tonnes. Not bad for a 700 kg magnetic breaking system, especially one that was optimized for mars EDL instead of this. Even if our estimates are way off, it's likely this could still provide significant mass savings. It's probably not worth developing just for the 1st stage, but if a similarly sized unit were to be built anyway for Red Dragon/2nd stage recovery, they might as well throw one in the 1st stage too. Awesome! I'd bet it could be even more useful for the 2nd stage. Since MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) has the biggest gains over mechanical drag at high elevations, I wonder  whether it could slow a 2nd stage down enough to survive atmospheric entry with just a small reentry burn. After all, Isp (read: fuel margins) is what Elon says is preventing 2nd stage reuse.  I have a few small nitpicks, though.  ~~&gt; capable of removing nearly 1 km/s of velocity from the 1st stage. That means that the atmospheric entry is now about 1.3 km/s rather than 1.7. That's a factor of 2.2 reduction~~  ~~1.7 - 1 = 1.3? :p~~  &gt;  According to Spaceflight101, the F9 1.1 1st stage has a dry mass of 23 MT.  The numbers I typically use for back of the envelope calculations are from [this table]( which estimates ~50 tonnes, also for F9 v1.1. Your source on the 23 tonne figure gives a range in the text:  &gt; can be estimated at around 23 to 26 metric tons, depending on the version used (earlier estimates ranged from 18 to 25 metric tons).  Can someone who knows more than me comment as to what a reasonable 95% confidence interval might be? It seems like we should be able to narrow it beyond a factor of 2. I haven's sat down and done the math myself though, so perhaps there really is that much uncertainty.  Luckily, for this calculation the dry mass is on the same order as the assumed ~10% fuel remaining, so exact number picked isn't quite as important. ###&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009;  Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, contractions, and other phrases which expand to something larger, that I\'ve seen in this thread:  |Fewer Letters|More Letters| |-------|---------| |[BEAM](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3oxjbk ""Used in this comment"")|[Bigelow Expandable Activity Module](| |[EDL](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3nojc4 ""Used in this comment"")|Entry/Descent/Landing| |[GTO](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3nf2do ""Used in this comment"")|[Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit](| |[I*_sp_*](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3ndesg ""Used in this comment"")|Specific impulse (as discussed by [Scott Manley]( and detailed by [David Mee]( on YouTube)| |[JCSAT](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3o3f52 ""Used in this comment"")|Japan Communications Satellite series, by JSAT Corp| |[LEO](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3n9rh1 ""Used in this comment"")|Low Earth Orbit (180-2000km)| |[LOX](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3nm6ui ""Used in this comment"")|Liquid Oxygen| |[MECO](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3ngehc ""Used in this comment"")|Main Engine Cut-Off| |[mT](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3nprpr ""Used in this comment"")|~~Milli-~~ *Metric* Tonnes| |[OCISLY](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3npklf ""Used in this comment"")|Of Course I Still Love You, Atlantic landing ~~barge~~ ship| |[PICA-X](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3o3f52 ""Used in this comment"")|Phenolic Impregnated-Carbon Ablative heatshield compound, as modified by SpaceX| |[RTLS](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3ngk46 ""Used in this comment"")|Return to Launch Site| |[TRL](/r/SpaceX/comments/4lh222//d3nzrf4 ""Used in this comment"")|Technology Readiness Level|  ---------------- ^(*Decronym is a community product of /r/SpaceX, implemented* )[*^by ^request*](   ^(I\'m a bot, and I first saw this thread at 28th May 2016, 20:55 UTC.)

Can you cite any source for this?  I can cite this NASA paper that calculated that a mars entry and descent needs, after use of a heat shield, an additional ~500 m/sec v for landing. But that is not retropropulsion!  Note that ... I'm a bot working hard to help Redditors find related videos to watch. *** [Play All]( | [Info]( | [Chrome Extension]( wow... that is a great perspective for reusability and landing on other planets. I am wondering, if the system works, could increase the efficiency of the electromagnet by immersing it into cryogenic liquefied helium and thus obtain same result as using superconducting electromagnet Isn't Elon doing an AMA soon?  This would be a great one to run by him. Someone **please** ask Elon what he plans to do with this awesome thingy in the AMA I am thinking about two things:  The first is, yeah, but where in the world do you install the coil system? that would need a redesign of the entire rocket, extend the core to make room for it or something, sadly this is a no no  Second, this could actually be used for a second stage recovery! you wont need a heavy heatshield that destroys your payload to orbit and you could potentially reenter engine-first so you could do a propulsive landing (i know upper stage engine wouldnt work well inside atmo), or maybe parachuting it.  On other side, this is a paper work right? if that's the case, a totally unproven tech is always a risky move, in my honest opinion i dont think spacex will follow that path, tho it would be awesome! This could also make returning the second stage possible too no? I love the general idea, but would be concerned that the tethered coils would be in the turbulent wake of the descending stage. Hypersonic parachutes are torn apart by that sort of turbulence, how would the magnetoshell be affected? Where/how does this system transfer the deltaV to the airframe? If the ionized air pushes back on the magnetic field which pushes back on the coil, then the coil will need to be mounted to load bearing members, probably dead-center. (OK, I'm not anything like a scientist/engineer...)  Also, this is mentioned in the comments: &gt; The gas molecuels are energized and ionized by their impact and then exert drag because they have the take a spiral trajectory along the field lines.  Will this system impart spin to the craft? If so, is it possible to counter this with two oppositely directed fields? (What are the forces involved in the interaction of those fields?)  (edit: formatting) Hmm... since you've got a nice tank of LOX onboard, maybe put the coil in that and use a low-temperature superconductor :) Not sure if (a) there's enough LOX at that point of the flight to be useful this way, or (b) whether pumping a bunch of kW through the coil will heat the LOX. (As a superconductor, does it have zero resistance and so doesn't generate heat when energized?) More testing is needed. Any unpredictable drag characteristics might make landing area ellipse too large for targeted barge landing or land landing Read through this thing.  Didn't see anything about how the system deals with the energy transfer from the friction/drag and the resultant heat load that that generates on the system or the spacecraft....energy has to go somewhere....  Maintaining stable EM fields in a contained plasma design is one of the big challenges for the magnetic confinement fusion community as they inch slowly toward a potential fusion reactor....and that's in a highly controlled environment.  Phase one and two are sub TRL level 4 which means a lot more theory and testing refinement is needed before we'll possibly see this. &gt; In the study, it was calculated that the 20 MT aeroshield  Ah, a 20 megatesla aeroshield.   Please just use the standard SI units and prefixes rather than making symbols up (the symbol for tonne is t). If you think there's going to be confusion with the American conventional units, expand and just call it a metric tonne, use Mg, or just use kg. [Here]( is an interesting slideshow on the technology. It seems pretty low TRL, but something SpaceX might have the opportunity to test. To summarize some of the things I\'ve seen in the comments, one of the few major problems with this idea is that the first stage may not actually be moving fast enough during the re-entry burn to ionize the atmosphere and sustain the plasma sheath necessary for this tech to work.   Does anyone know how fast the stage is moving at that point, and whether or not the surrounding air actually ionizes sufficiently during that time (I know that it gets hot enough to scorch things like the grid fins, but ""hot"" is still a ways away from ""plasma"")?  Edit: Never mind, already addressed. Alas for lower capture speeds... I would just like to say, thank you for linking your previous posts and for being thorough and sharing sources and your information. There's a lot of great reading to be done, by myself, thanks to this post!",204,/r/ShittySpaceXIdeas  Generating your own magnetic confined plasma envelopes is very low on TRL. No one has done it in space before.,1

There's not much back-and-forth control   movement - which suggests that SpaceX has achieved a high degree   of control over the profile of the descent. - The grid fins are deployed early on, but there is no (or only very limited) grid fin    motion up until the re-entry burn, only RCS thrusters are used to control direction.    I believe this is done because before the re-entry burn the grid fins are only used    to increase drag and to stabilize the position of the rocket by having higher drag    at the tail of the flying body - but there's not enough drag yet in the thin atmosphere    to truly tilt or roll the rocket. - During most of the descent the first stage 'overshoots' OCISLY's position:   i.e. the rocket is intentionally angled beyond OCISLY's position, but is   still generally flying in the plane of descent. This is done way beyond what OCISLY   range safety considerations would require, see for example [this angle at ~90km   altitude]( - the first stage is    still pointing 100-200 km beyond OCISLY's position, beyond the retrograde    tangent of the trajectory. - But shortly before the [re-entry burn is performed](    RCS thrusters are used to line up the first stage to point almost exactly towards    OCISLY's position. (I believe this was done to point the thrust vector straight    into retrograde burn direction, to maximize the fuel-efficiency of the deceleration burn.) - After the re-entry burn was done **both** the grid fins and RCS thrusters were   used to move the stage [back into 'gliding position' again](    (I speculate that this dual control method was used either because at that    altitude the control authority of the grid fins alone is not strong enough yet,    or because the control software found it a high priority to do that re-direction    of the rocket.)  Previously it was assumed that the first stage was using itself as a lifting body to precisely control its down-range position. This is certainly true to a degree,  but looking at this position-marked video suggests that SpaceX has a high  degree of control over the profile of the descent and the position of landing,  and that the 'gliding' was possibly done for two other major reasons as well:  - to intentionally create lift to make the descent less vertical: the more horizontal   the stage can fly, the more time it has to slow down more gently while going   deeper and deeper into an increasingly thicker atmosphere, without taking major    damage. This is possible only to a limited degree before the re-entry burn,   because the atmosphere is still very thin and any lift is weak, but this effect   is much stronger after the re-entry burn has been performed. - to intentionally increase drag and thus to save fuel creatively: it's better to    not use RP-1 to slow you down, but to use the atmosphere. By now SpaceX likely    has a much better understanding about how much punishment the first stage can    take, and can use aerodynamically more aggressive approaches to use less fuel.  The above observations I think also explain that while the Thaicom-8 launch was almost a carbon copy of the JCSAT-14 launch (same MECO cutoff and speed, within 0.1%), still OCISLY was waiting 20km further downrange: the first stage was able to 'glide longer', and thus was able to both re-enter more softly and save fuel.  I'd also like to note that Thaicom-8 performed its re-entry burn 8 seconds earlier than JCSAT-14 did - and thus was able to do the max*_Q_* portion of its descent at about 20% lower kinetic energies than JCSAT-14. This explains why the Thaicom-8 lander still had its engine covers and generally looks to be in a much better shape than JCSAT-14 did.  The price was a slightly flatter angle of the final approach to OCISLY than JCSAT-14: and this could have contributed to the too high landing speed that crushed the crumple zone of a leg and tilted the stage slightly.  I suspect the Falcon Heavy center core, with its higher structural robustness, will be able to do even more of that to manage its speed without spending fuel!  As usual, these observations are highly speculative, please don't hesitate to point out  any mistakes and misconceptions!   (Note to moderators: I hope it was fine to post this as a separate article!)  _*edit: smaller corrections*_ Interesting note about the camera itself - It looks like the glass/transparent cover for the camera cracked, just like on the CRS-8 landing video. After that cracking though, it looks like the cover continued to degrade until it was completely destroyed. I'm glad the camera survived, and that the view was so beautiful. It would be interesting if the [landing zone area]( could be superimposed over the video (maybe using Google Earth?) and then check if the stage ever points outside it.

Perhaps I should assume that Arianespace and ULA already have a boat in the Atlantic tracking the return (the Soviets always did for NASA launches), but I'm certain the ULA summer interns will go through this frame by frame next week and using the cloud positions, sun angle, etc come up with estimates of the complete return burn process (angles, velocities, adjustments).  I like a great supersonic retropulsion rocket pr0n video with my Saturday morning coffee as much as the next person, but I hope that SpaceX is keeping the secret sauce close to their vest, so that Arianespace and ULA don't easily ape them and all the hard work they've done. Recall just how many data feeds, videos, etc we get from the other guys when they do a launch. Amazing detective work! Thank you for sharing it!  Really curious here, how did you figure out where the landing zone /asds was on the video footage? planned trajectory, cloud-as-landmark, reverse the video playback...? Watching this, it occurred to me that a Falcon 9 landing is probably the fastest that anything has been landed from that altitude. Probably by *far*. Can anyone think of something that has landed faster, non-destructively? Excellent commentary. Thanks for doing this. Much to read in this thread. Hey guys. For anyone who wants to get some insight on the landing: Check out this video by a streamer on twitch:  I certainly don't want to trivialize the hard work that SpaceX does, but this might be a format that is easier to understand and maybe more entertaining. The streamers on twitch regularly cover spacex launches and might be a cool place to chill for some post flight analysis. Just wanted to add my thanks to your friend for this awesome content.  I had been looking at the original versions thinking, ""wow the drone ship is down there *somewhere* in that ocean"" ... and now your friend has shown us exactly where it is!

I wouldn't think it would be cost effective to recover. I feel like we need a computer animation of how this is suppose to work. We got one very early in the first stage recovery but we have never gotten the 'big picture' look with fairing recovery. Unless I missed one I don't know about. They don't need to decelerate from hypersonic velocities with thrusters because the ballistic coefficient of these fairings is HUGE so they should decelerate very rapidly before they get much in the way of re-entry heating.  Theoretically, it may even be possible to decelerate from orbital velocities without a heat shield if you can expand your surface area to a very very high amount. This increases your drag significantly in the very rarified area of the high atmosphere so you get much less heating than you would if you were lower in the atmosphere. Auti-steering back to where GoSearcher is located, would be awesome. It's interesting to learn the whole setup like packaging and unpacking after fairing sep. Interesting to see that finally one of the first concepts for spacecraft recovery is going to be used. Paragliders were already considered back in the gemini days : So I think there are multiple good reasons for using steerable gliding chutes instead of 'dumb chutes':  - during ASDS landings they allow the two fairing halves to land next to the OCISLY support ship, reducing recovery time and reducing time spent in sea water - for Falcon Heavy launches the higher speed launch might result in the center core fairing halves being separated further from each other. You really don't want the support ship spending a day or two fishing them out from a 30x30 km recovery box, rapidly widening due to ocean currents...  For example if one of the fairings lands in the middle of the Gulf Stream it can easily drift away at 6 km/h. In 10 hours it's already 60 km farther away, in 20 hours it's a 100 kms out - with an ever weakening radio beacon signal. So you absolutely want to concentrate the landing points of all two fairings in a relatively small area and recover them quickly.  Furthermore, during RTLS landings steerabale parachutes are probably mission critical: you don't want upper level winds to move them back over land in two scenarios:  - when launching from Vandy you don't want the jet stream upper level winds to blow the fairing back to California. (On Cape Canaveral the jet stream is typically blowing out to the ocean, so this should not be much of a problem there.) - or if your ascent corridor is pretty constrained in width like on Boca Chica, going near islands and oil platforms, you don't want the uncertainty of fairing landings widen the exclusion zone. The jet stream sometimes dips that far south and can blow both inland and out to the sea.  So I think steerable chutes are more than just about convenience of recovery, they might simplify Falcon Heavy fairing recovery logistics, and they are probably also mission-critical for launch sites that are not in Florida.  *_edit: fix logic fail pointed out by /u/Goolic below_* A few thoughts and questions:  * Will recovery of fairings be used to find ways to build them more cheaply, and not just achieve economies due to reuse?  * Is there some cost point at which fairings could be made so cheaply that the economics of reuse would ironically be undermined?  * Are the fairing halves not attached to each other in some way to avoid banging against each other on descent? Why not stage recovery helicopters on the landing barge? Have them take off at booster launch and wait for the fairings to drop In? Seems more direct to me. They'd drop fairings on deck then land alongside to be tied down. Enough fuel would have to be loaded for copters to make it one way to shore if the drone ship is detonated by high speed impact of the returning booster. Other than that, why not? Has there been any discussion on fairings that do not separate fully, so that the two halfes can come together into a whole fairing before re-entry?   Like keep one side as stronger pushers and on the other side replace them with cables that can be released/pushed out for separation and then retracted to bring the fairings back together. The innovation that comes from SpaceX is inspiring. SO happy to see him pioneering the way for such technology which seems so practical. Go Elon! Everybody is assuming a splashdown.  Don't these parachutes have a very long horizontal distance? Can't wait for this on a FH, if they can manage a stage 2 recovery it's a big step to win the [CATS prize](",379,Already got my high stakes bet on recovery happening on the next mission with fairings.,0

Somebody who gets it. Rare. Stop calling it a Tesla accident. It's a trailer truck accident.    ~~Funny~~ articles don't mention the brand of the truck or the name of it's driver actually causing the accident.    Edit: sorry, this topic is not funny ...or how much it understands the method of maliciously manipulating perfectly sound markets. An overall decent article marred by comments about Silicon Valley helping create Trump and ISIS.   I mean, cmon. I know they want to link people to other articles they've written, but that just feels hackish. Great article, but what does Silicon Valley have to do with Trump and ISIS? What a bizarre comment. It is definitely disappointing how news reports framed the collision in a way that faults Tesla entirely. Especially given the points made by this article. While I doubt there\'s any malicious intent behind it, and I don\'t even necessarily think it\'s a full \'misunderstanding\' of technology, I have to imagine the articles that resulted are simply the product that sells better (gripping headlines!).  ""Driverless car dooms helpless driver"" Or ""Car accident, driver perishes""  Sadly tis the way that the business of media has evolved. ""Im not usually one to apologize for Silicon Valleyan industry that has helped give rise to Donald Trump and ISIS and is changing the world""  Wait what?! Click-bait much? Good article.  The standard critique of the ""Autopilot"" name was of course unnecessary, and could have been avoided by a quick 45 second research on what an autopilot traditionally does.  When the Tesla Autopilot reaches full autonomy  THAT\'S when it\'ll become inappropriate for Tesla to call it ""Autopilot"". Although by that time autopilots in the traditional sense might have evolved, too. my first though when finding out about the tragic death was "" what was the driver doing?"" come to find out this dude was watching a movie while his car was in autopilot. so how\'s the car to blame? i\'m sure when they first released cruise control there were cases like this.  WTF?? trump and ISIS? I liked the intro. Sure but this isn't the general public, this is professional journalism.  People who are supposed to research the subject before they write about it. I feel like the article doesn't make it clear that many deaths worldwide involve cars that lack essential safety features and are being driven in chaotic urban environments (ie. developing countries), as a contrast to the S, which even without AP is still one of the safest cars built and is usually driven in orderly urban environments (ie. Western countries). That said, I'd say that Autopilot is still safer than human drivers, but not to the extent that common statistics suggest. The fact that Fortune magazine featured a [paid anti-electric car article]( connected to the Koch brothers\' anti-electric car campaign suggests at the very least a monetary/contractual/ideological relationship between the Koch brothers and Fortune magazine.  The fact that Fortune has featured a series of relentlessly anti-Tesla articles recently seems to suggest a connection to the Koch article.  It is neither unreasonable nor paranoid to speculate that there may be an arrangement between the Koch\'s anti-electric car and Fortune magazine to not only print paid content, but to also tilt their editorial content against Tesla.    Really what makes me strongly suspect that there is such an arrangement is the effort Fortune editorial staff seem to be exerting to attack Tesla.  The article that used ""boilerplate"" language present in all of Tesla\'s stockholder filings in order suggest something nefarious seemed particularly contorted.  It is almost as if there have been editorial meetings at Fortune to brainstorm ways to damage Tesla.    Fortune Magazine is a staid publication that has a wide readership and a great deal of prestige.  It would be a shame if its editorial opinions were now for sale to the highest bidder. Hmlmoppppppqa  H Came to read a TLDR of the article... only found comments on Trump and ISIS. The part that no one talked about, and that no one talks about regardless of Tesla, is that light camouflage can be dangerous. It's why I HATE not being able to legally turn my headlights off (because the only option would leave running lights on, and that's illegal). If you drive a dark car and the sun is setting behind you so that your car is casting a long shadow in front of you, your headlights are REDUCING your visibility to cars in front of you (and potentially pulling out in front of you). This is old news as WWII bombers put lights on the leading edges of their wings to hide the plane's visibility against a bright sky (when hunting subs in North Atlantic). A variation on bright camouflage is what tricked the Tesla algorithm. TLDR- Bright light can dangerously hide things just as the dark can.     *Edit: I don't have a Tesla and don't know what options they have. My car is lights on all the time.",226,"failed to mention how most news organizations make money from old car companies and have a vested interest in slamming tesla.  Could have drawn a diagram of the accident to show how unlikely it was for anyone to escape the accident.  didn't add anything that wasn't in the tesla new release.  Lazy work.  C- &gt;""How the Media Screwed Up....""  I hate that statement. The media has no other job than to satisfy advertisers, and get more eye balls. Their job is not to educate. Everyone here thinking computers can drive better than humans are nuts.  I've been driving 30 years with zero accidents.  There's no way I'd plow into a tractor trailer without braking or trying an evasive maneuvers.  The car kept driving as if there was nothing there",8

Still so new and in beta and already with a lower fatality rate than regular cars. I don't know there's enough data to say definitively it's safer, since there are other factors.  That said, it's clearly not a dangerous murder machine either, so IMO the data is relevant there. Its not really a fair comparison.  #1: The demographics of Tesla drivers aren't.... you know... the same as your average driver of a 2001 used Toyota Corolla.  Tesla drivers are overwhelmingly older, wealthy, educated, and have families.  So they are already in the favorable crashes/miles category.  #2:  Tesla's are really safe vehicles after the collision.  You are just more likely to walk away anyways, regardless of why or how you got in the crash.  So, Elon is cheesing the numbers a little bit here I think, but it doesn't bother me much cuz the other team is cheating too. I would argue that the comparison should not be a significant determination of safety yet, as it is a single incident that represents an edge case.  * Its a single incident, so I am not sure how valuable it is statistically * This is a car vs semi truck trailer incident, which is a worse case scenario for how lethal the crash is.  Most of the safety features of the car such as crash zones, airbags, seatbelts, ect were useless in this specific type of crash. * Auto-pilot is predominantly engaged on highways and freeways and really should only be compared to the number of deaths that average on highway/freeway driving, since Highway/freeway vs regular city driving are a lot different. I love Tesla and autopilot, but a better comparison would be to compare only miles driven in conditions when Autopilot could apply.   Hypothetically, human-driven cars might crash more often off the highway than on the highway. Autopilot only helps on the highway. It is theoretically possible for the number of crashes per mile driven for human drivers to be worse than autopilot, but at the same time the number of crashes per human-driven mile on a separated highway could be less than autopilot.   In don't have this expertise, but I imagine the accidents per highway mile number would be lower than the total average because most accidents probably happen at intersections. Does anyone know this info? Autopilot or not, the Tesla Model S is touted as one of the safest cars in the world.  I agree that it would be interesting and pertinent to show the fatality statistics for the Model S as a whole, not just miles driven with Autopilot.  I wouldn't be surprised if it exceeds 130 million miles. With over 2 billion miles driven, if there have been fewer than 15 fatalities in the Model S, then the AP+non-AP stat would be better than 130 million miles.",22,"It's not a good or fair comparison, but it makes Tesla look good, so they go with it.  Same with the whole safest car ever thing, the Model S only excels in NHTSA tests, in the Euro NCAP tests its competitors are designed for, the Model S is good, but nothing outstanding.  Tesla has a habit of pushing big marketing points regardless of the truth behind them.  But I agree, comparing an S with Autopilot and an S without Autopilot would be the best (and arguably only) way to get accurate data.",5

It examines a number of possible scenarios regarding the outline of MCT, and the envelope of its capabilities pertaining to spaceflight. It misses one thing though, in my opinion.  **The business logic.**  Don't get me wrong; this is an idealistically perfect outcome for MCT from a spaceflight-oriented fan perspective. But I think a number of fans are getting carried away here - including yourself. In fact, MCT+BFR could be quite conservative, at least initially, compared to some fan predictions. Indeed, I hope it is!  Risk is a huge part of doing business. The more complicated you make something, the greater your chance of failure (define failure?) you could incur, and the greater that failure can be. Risk and failure are certainly correlated, and anyone who takes even a basic economics course covers this sort of thing as part of their education. [Elon Musk has regrets about how the Model X was developed, and how it was managed]( indeed, if we ever learn more about that saga, it could become a fantastic business case study of a near-failure that was saved be genius. I really hope for the sake of schedule-reliability and all round sanity, MCT+BFR is carefully crafted and considered.   For this reason, *I suspect BFR+MCT will be a groundbreaking design, but to reduce capital investment cost, risk, and schedule concerns; it will be rather simple (comparatively)* - elegant might be a better word.  # What do we know?  * **Falcon 9 &amp; Falcon Heavy are fantastic vehicles.** The do their jobs well, and they do it reliably. There is no good reason to shorten their lifespan just yet. Sure, BFR could serve as a replacement one day, but why design that functionality immediately when you have 2 perfectly acceptable vehicles anyway?     If this drives up costs in a significant way (which it could definitely do), they cannot afford to have a cash squeeze here. If there is a whiff of speculation SpaceX has bitten off more than they could chew, investors could pull out, or it could be harder to find new sources of income (launching Falcon won't be enough to cover the shortfall). A similar scenario to this is described in Ashlee Vance's Musk biography.  * **Building rockets is expensive. Sending people to Mars is more so.** They will need all the capital they can get. You therefore, obviously, have an intent to minimize overall expenditure.       It's this reason why I believe MCT+BFR **will not be capable of carrying payloads** into orbit. BFR is the first stage, MCT + a refueler design is the second stage. *There is no fairing, there is no payload adapter*. It's a least initially a waste of time and money (opportunity cost is a thing!) to shoehorn that sort of functionality into an architecture designed for Mars.       BFR+MCT *should be* a dovetail of perfect, unifying focus with one goal: getting to Mars. Even if it's at the expense of fans' dreams. You need to save every penny and every bit of mass to make this work and make it cheap.  # And what does BFR+MCT need to be?  * **As simple as possible.** This means constraining it to as few launcher configurations as required. Three is simply too much. There's MCT and a refueler. It's a *Mars* architecture after all. If someone else wants to build a generic second stage which can sit atop the BFR stack - fine, that'd be lovely. But they need to stay focused here.  * **It needs to optimize for mass beyond belief.** Even at these scales, I disagree that this is a problem that can be solved by strong-willed desires to add more propellant and brute thrust. Any extra mass in an MCT/Refueler design to make it reconfigurable for pure cargo payloads outside of the realm of Mars are in my mind unachievable at this point in time.   * **A *Mars* Colonial Transporter**. Like, it's in the name - and I do think it's a well considered limitation. Mars is realistically the only business case in space that makes sense (if you agree with Musk's statements about asteroid mining not being a feasible goal) - designing it for even more speculative markets is not a rational business decision.      I'm a software guy. Writing software sucks. If there's anything I feel like in software engineering is applicable to *actual* engineering, it's that refactoring things is hard. Concrete classes, concrete methods, probably even real concrete. Designing a perfect system without writing a line of code is a very hard thing to do, and is seldom accomplished. It's difficulty increases as a function of scope. Falcon 9 was refactored at least twice (that we know about!). We can't afford to see MCT+BFR refactored, which again comes circling back around to risk.   What it does not need to be is a general purpose launcher. All these things you propose will happen in time. But I pray it's not a Model X. Even BFR will be one small step, but one giant leap for mankind.   ___  **TL;DR**: While it's great to dream about what MCT/BFR might be, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves. This post, while nice from a STEM-oriented view, has significant business+accounting+finance shortfalls that need addressing.   ^(I'm going to keep updating this post throughout the night with my thoughts. It will probably be refactored when you read it next.) Hopefully this post does not fall under post-launch restrictions.  I've collected various quotes from Elon Musk which I think paint a picture that suggest that the MCT is not going to be Mars-only - it's also going to be the future main launch system and spaceship line SpaceX will use in the future, for Mars, near Earth commercial/CRS and (eventual) solar system missions.  Speculative, as usual.  As /u/EchoLogic mentioned, if you cant get a business case then everything technical is all for naught. Even if it's technically possible but it doesn't make sense for business then there's no reason to actually attempt it. I hope you try to propose a business plan to some venture capitalists sometime. It would be a good learning experience.  I'll write a full response once I have time to fully read your post. In the future you should practice in condensing your posts into smaller blocks of information rather than writing essays. It helps people digest your information without getting side tracked and also makes for more concise reading. Less stream-of-consciousness and more technical-paper. &gt;MCT is the main and sole future spaceship line SpaceX is concentrating on, which will not only get humanity to Mars but is going to service all the commercial space jobs around Earth and the solar system as well  It would certainly make good commercial sense to use BFR for 'alternate destination launches' in the 26 month interim between Mars launch windows.  &gt;it will replace the Falcon 9 / Falcon Heavy launchers in time  IMO unlikely to happen for a very long time. Falcon 9 is too convenient for launching Earth orbit payloads, Falcon Heavy should be great for dropping cargo on Mars. Both these vehicles will likely see a makeover, it could be argued installing Raptor on upper stage is the first step in this process. Elon Musk has certainly indicated they will be flying Falcon 9 for the foreseeable future.  &gt; We do know it from previous leaks and public comments by Elon that there are going to be at least three kinds of distinct roles of the MCT:  * 'Crew' transport capability: the MCT shipping 100 people to Mars  * 'Cargo' transport capability: shipping 100 tons of cargo to Mars  SpaceX might decide to combine crew and cargo functions on the MCT. Making one vehicle to convey both cargo and crew would reduce development resources required and align with their multi-use philosophy. Simple is perfect, considering their resources are finite and this will cost a bundle. 100% agree. We saw it happen with falcon 1 payloads being moved to the falcon 9. It's the same principle being taken to the next level. Classic Musk scaling. ###&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009;  Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, contractions, and other phrases which expand to something larger, that I\'ve seen in this thread:  |Fewer Letters|More Letters| |-------|---------| |[ACES](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5jxpmd ""Used in this comment"")|[Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage](| | |[Advanced Crew Escape Suit](| |[ASDS](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5kutld ""Used in this comment"")|Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (landing platform)| |[ATV](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5j5d24 ""Used in this comment"")|[Automated Transfer Vehicle]( ESA cargo craft| |[BFR](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5m4lgf ""Used in this comment"")|Big ~~Fu-~~ *Falcon* Rocket| |[BFS](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5kv5p6 ""Used in this comment"")|Big ~~Fu-~~ Falcon Spaceship (see MCT)| |[CFD](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5j2cpz ""Used in this comment"")|Computational Fluid Dynamics| |[COPV](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5jhkjf ""Used in this comment"")|[Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel](| |[CRS](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5ks1c1 ""Used in this comment"")|[Commercial Resupply Services contract with NASA](| |[DoD](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5ije1n ""Used in this comment"")|US Department of Defense| |[DRO](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5i0bsi ""Used in this comment"")|[Distant Retrograde Orbit](| |[EDL](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5jdbuf ""Used in this comment"")|Entry/Descent/Landing| |[ESA](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5ia7zm ""Used in this comment"")|European Space Agency| |[FFSC](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5jgse6 ""Used in this comment"")|Full-Flow Staged Combustion| |[GEO](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5knjuf ""Used in this comment"")|Geostationary Earth Orbit (35786km)| |[GSE](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5i0mya ""Used in this comment"")|Ground Support Equipment| |[GSO](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5jkmow ""Used in this comment"")|Geosynchronous Orbit (any Earth orbit with a 24-hour period)| |[GTO](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5jjyzd ""Used in this comment"")|[Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit](| |[I*_sp_*](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5kto39 ""Used in this comment"")|Specific impulse (as discussed by [Scott Manley]( and detailed by [David Mee]( on YouTube)| |[ISRU](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5imxmk ""Used in this comment"")|[In-Situ Resource Utilization](| |[JWST](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5i7zs0 ""Used in this comment"")|James Webb infra-red Space Telescope| |[KSC](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5iwoag ""Used in this comment"")|Kennedy Space Center, Florida| |[L1](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5im6m1 ""Used in this comment"")|[Lagrange Point]( 1 of a two-body system, between the bodies| |[L2](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5jxpmd ""Used in this comment"")|Paywalled section of the NasaSpaceFlight forum| | |[Lagrange Point]( 2 of a two-body system, beyond the smaller body ([Sixty Symbols]( video explanation)| |[LEO](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5kx26p ""Used in this comment"")|Low Earth Orbit (180-2000km)| |[LOX](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5k3317 ""Used in this comment"")|Liquid Oxygen| |[MCT](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5psgu5 ""Used in this comment"")|Mars Colonial Transporter| |[MECO](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5kutld ""Used in this comment"")|Main Engine Cut-Off| |[NRO](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5idij8 ""Used in this comment"")|(US) National Reconnaissance Office| |[PICA-X](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5jnprz ""Used in this comment"")|Phenolic Impregnated-Carbon Ablative heatshield compound, as modified by SpaceX| |[QA](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5hxv0v ""Used in this comment"")|Quality Assurance/Assessment| |[RCS](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5imp82 ""Used in this comment"")|Reaction Control System| |[RP-1](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5jpeae ""Used in this comment"")|Rocket Propellant 1 (enhanced kerosene)| |[RTLS](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5kutld ""Used in this comment"")|Return to Launch Site| |[SD](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5iiu7s ""Used in this comment"")|SuperDraco hypergolic abort/landing engines| |[SEP](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5i256d ""Used in this comment"")|Solar Electric Propulsion| |[SLS](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5kx26p ""Used in this comment"")|Space Launch System heavy-lift| |[SSTO](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5j219e ""Used in this comment"")|Single Stage to Orbit| |[TMI](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5ksfih ""Used in this comment"")|Trans-Mars Injection maneuver| |[TWR](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5kutld ""Used in this comment"")|Thrust-to-Weight Ratio| |[ULA](/r/SpaceX/comments/4tk5tm//d5jxpmd ""Used in this comment"")|United Launch Alliance (Lockheed/Boeing joint venture)|  ---------------- ^(*Decronym is a community product of /r/SpaceX, implemented* )[*^by ^request*](   ^(I\'m a bot, and I first saw this thread at 19th Jul 2016, 10:56 UTC.)   [^\\[Acronym ^lists\\]]( [^\\[Contact ^creator\\]]( [^\\[PHP ^source ^code\\]]( I think just the fuel cost of launching BFR will be in the tens of millions of dollars. That sounds like it's not that economical unless it's an absolute requirement for an absurdly heavy payload. &gt;The 'Refueling MCT' might essentially be just the same as 'Cargo MCT', with the cargo hold replaced by a minimal nose cone.  I would think that the Big F****** Tanker would have stretched tanks relative to the other MCT variants. After all, it's only purpose in life is to carry up as much fuel as it can and then come back for more.  And SpaceX has already done the stretched tank thing with the F9. Rather than viewing Elon\'s tweet as support for your theories on this, I actually consider it to be a pretty strong refutation. If SpaceX were considering retiring Falcon 9 and FH and using BFR/MCT exclusively, making the second-stage of the Falcon family re-usable would not be ""tempting"" in the slightest. It would be a waste of time and money. The sheer size of the rocket will make reusability much MUCH easier. It's pretty easy to return the second stage when your max payload is a least twice whatever payload you put on it! As I said in the other thread, someone should just ask him, either now via twitter, or after the IAC presentation... &gt;Really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too...    ... because it would make sense to do so if we could...  &gt;but prob best to stay focused on the Mars rocket...    ...because we have limited engineering and financial resources.    Meaning no, the MCT will not be a *lot* more than a Mars rocket. Well it is sort of like that ""Direct 2"" Rocket. that was proposed to just launch several sats with  orbital insertion tugs and tugs all at once. I\'m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt for the most part, but your manned mission examples are ridiculous.  &gt; * Manned Venus orbital and atmospheric sample taking and return missions become possible of box if the MCT upper stage has the speculated ~8 km/s v budget which it needs to enable speedy transfer to Mars . &gt; * Manned Moon landing. &gt; * Manned missions to the main asteroid belt and back. &gt; * Even a manned Mercury landing becomes possible with the MCT (if supported by 2-3 expendable Refueling-MCT spaceships)  The US government moves in many illogical ways, so sadly I can\'t reject such irrationality out of hand, but there is no case at this point for a manned mission to any of those. Well, except the moon, of course. I\'m a big believer in the viability of a ""cloud city"" on Venus, so in the long term I would love to see manned missions to Venus, but certainly not for atmospheric sample return. Sample return in general is a bit of an engineering problem, but surely atmospheric samples have to be the easiest kind to collect and return autonomously.  (At risk of getting side-tracked, the factor that convinced me of the favourability of Mars over Venus was the inaccessibility of the Venerian surface with current technology. Without access to non-gaseous resources, a Venus colony would never be able to be independent and thus could never be part of humanity\'s ""backup"".)  Oh, and please stop commenting with apologetic disclaimers for starting new posts. My reaction upon seeing them is always ""oo, /u/__Rocket__ posted a new technical essay"". They\'re invariably much more interesting than the mainstream media articles that pop up here from time to time. I think your analysis is spot on, in the long run. The questions that it does not address is time lines. Will there be a long enough period before the MCT/BFR can fulfill these roles, that there is a place for a fully reusable Falcon Heavy? Remember the Falcon Heavy is a much more complex system than single stick F9. Even more complex is a fully reusable FH. If everything went right and stayed on schedule with the fully reusable FH, then it would be cheaper per launch then the single stick F9, and it would eventually replace it for all ~small launches.  There is a risk/reward calculation to be done here. What are the chances of FH being easy to operate and staying on schedule? It has a pretty poor track record for staying on schedule so far, and the complexity issue has many unknowns. I think the calculation is a pure business one: a late, fully reusable FH would eat up a lot of company resources, and it would be replaced by an MCT/BFR model before it has time to pay back the investment. Therefore, it becomes like the Falcon 5:^* A good rocket that never gets finished, for good business reasons.  ^* Falcon 5 would have been the perfect vehicle to launch some of the lighter expendable payloads launched in 2010-2015, the last of which was Jason 3. The expense of finishing Falcon 5 and of maintaining 2 assembly lines would have been greater than any savings, and it would have diverted resources away from the F9 booster landing program. So Falcon 5 remains a pile of parts in some corner of some storage area in Hawthorn, and Falcon 9 launches a few payloads for which it is grossly over sized. It'd probably be better to turn upper stages into propellant depot segments and tugs than bring them back to Earth. They are in some ways more valuable in LEO or GEO staging orbit than back on the surface. Time to hire more engineers I agree. If mars is to work, MCT and BFR must be highly reliable, and very reusable.  And if they are strongly reusable and reliable, then it starts making a ridiculous amount of sense to make a payload variant with a shuttle style bay for deploying cargo into orbit, rather than using vehicles where they still have to throw tens of millions of dollars worth of equipment away per launch.  They'd still need F9/F9H for oddball orbits, though, since unless they are *ridiculously* reliable, MCT/BFR are still constrained by their flight path. And it seems unlikely to be worth it to develop the launch infrastructure for the pair elsewhere(unless, through refueling in orbit, they could get the delta-v needed to make serious plane change maneuvers). One giant rocket will never replace all other rockets unless some sort of propellant-less propulsion becomes a reality. We go to space for many different reasons. Can you see SpaceX launching an entire MCT to just get a 500kg NASA satellite like DSCOVR to it's destination? Because it would have to if they didn't have a F9. MCT has a lot of power but your not going to be able to get 30 different missions to their own orbits with a single launch. Meaning more launches, wasted payload space, and tons of extra fuel burned. MCTs won't have an unlimited life span. Just like we don't fly the biggest plane we have for every plane flight. Why not just launch a smaller rocket? More likely in my opinion is that after MCT proves it works, and mars gets up and running, a smaller launcher is created that is fully reusable to replace the Falcon family. That is why it is tempting, because he knows he will probably have to do it at some point but he needs to stay focused on the bigger goal right now to get to mars as soon as possible. &gt;It gets better than that: with full reusability of the upper stage even a full BFR+MCT launch, despite its huge mass, is going to be significantly cheaper to launch than a current Falcon 9 launch  Can you elaborate? Is methane less expensive than RP-1? Hmm. Maybe this is just the English teacher in me, but in the context of him talking about the Falcon Heavy wouldn't it logically make more sense for him to be discussing the Mars rocket (a Falcon Heavy presumably) that will be going to Mars in 2018 rather than the unknown BFR? One MCT fuel depot in orbit could refuel a lot of satellites. You would probably need smaller fueling crafts to approach and fuel, but one giant fuel depot in space would be worth a lot to satellite providers. No and yes.  All of SpaceX advancements and technologies have been to make space flight less expensive in order to get humanity on Mars (and beyond).  The Falcon 9 and now Falcon Heavy are part of those technologies that SpaceX has used to gain knowledge to build and fund the BFR/MCT.  The F9 and FH won't be initially obsolete by launches by BFR, but eventually will eclipse them.  Each respective platforms have an eventual shelf life where SpaceX is better suited with focus and resources on BFR/MCT.  At some point if there is a need to have a smaller launcher than the BFR, say for sat launches that are smaller and BFR being too expensive (and other companies aren't really developing there) I think you will see a 1-3 engine fully Raptor powered Methane Falcon than continual manufacturing of F9/FH RP-1 with Merlins.  This Falcon Raptor (FR or FR3) will be made as a replacement to the F9/FH but as an evolutionary decedent of BFR rather than F9/FH getting spliced with some BFR tech.  I dont know the speculated thrust levels of Raptor off-hand but a 3-4m version similar to the size of the F9 with resuablitiy for both stages (or just make 1 big stage if low level throttling) seems acceptable based on where I could see the market by 2025-2030.  However I don't see SpaceX spending much capital doing that unless other competitors aren't filling that void.  I think they want to keep focusing on the next frontier and technology than moving backwards back to GTO/GSO/LEO for smaller payloads. No, it's just not that big of a deal to have a recoverable 2nd stage Falcon Heavy. Falcon 2nd stages are designed to be really cheap vs the 1st stage.  Not worth the time vs reward compared to getting MCT done.

I'm a bot working hard to help Redditors find related videos to watch. *** [Info]( | Get it on [Chrome]( / [Firefox]( Yay!  More MCT speculation.  I think MCT will not be 3 spaceships but just two- a tanker and a crewed version.  For the refueling mission you remove the heat shield and for the crew module you simply replace one of the fuel tanks deep inside the vehicle and turn it into a habitation module.  This means no crew escape module so no launching of people on the MCT.  People will be launched on Dragons and Falcon 9 or possibly an enhanced Dragon on a Falcon Heavy.  Then they meet up in orbit when the MCT is fully fueled.  The heat shield is on the top of the vehicle which performs a ""skip entry"" on Mars, does a 180 degree turn in the upper atmosphere and then lands like a Falcon 9.  The Dragon separates in High Mars orbit and loops around Mars and back to Earth for a splashdown.  As far as launching other stuff using the MCT I don\'t see it unless somebody decides to build a 15 meter wide 2nd stage.  MCT will be designed to barely get into orbit where it is refueled.  At best you would have a capacity launch the weight of the crew compartment on MCT which is what?  100,000 pounds?  Of course if you also refuel it on orbit, then you can take that 100,000 pounds to just about anywhere in the solar system.  The other notion is using BFR as in effect a SSTO to launch a payload as big as MCT to LEO.  That is 250,000 pounds or more.  I am no rocket but I suspect this is much easier to do than designing an entirely new second stage and gives you a lot bigger bang.  I wonder if you could simply make a cargo space by taking out everything in the MCT except the outer (15 Meter) ring and leave a huge internal volume for satellites and a deployment mechanism?  Pretty sure this could only get sats to LEO and not GTO. Imagine a 15m space telescope! Imagine further jwst style mirrors and a 30m aperture without any atmosphere in the way! I don't see that anyone has mentioned what seems like the obvious use of the MCT to me- a use that avoids Echo's concerns because it would require no changes whatsoever to the basic structure, whatever that basic structure happens to be.  Simply put, the MCT as defined _has_ to be capable of putting 100 people in space with a reasonable amount of comfort to last them to Mars.  That's its job.  If it can do that, it can put 100 people into LEO for a day or two (or rather longer).  To hell with servicing trips!  Even if your estimates are wrong, and it costs more than a falcon9 launch (say, 100 million dollars), that's about 1M per ticket (and here we are still twice Elon's target price for getting people all the way to Mars).  How many tourists could you get for 1M per ticket into low earth orbit for a week?  How much for a cruise around the moon (with a higher ticket price  to cover in-orbit refueling)? What would researchers pay for a 1 month temporary space station?  Hell, you could stuff one to the gills with mostly automated experiments and send a handful of people up to mind them. I think the F9 will be semi-retired. The FH can run all F9 missions with the added bonus of more payload and all ground pad landing. Most F9 missions will not be ground landed and SpaceX is only 1 for 3 in a retrievable and immediately reusable core from water landings. While they can probably bring this success rate up it's pretty clear from a risk stand point that they are better off trying for ground landings. My pet theory is that center core FH will be F9 cores that are near the end of their life cycle or require lots of remanufacturing because of a bad landing. This allows the two boosters to be reliably landed on the ground and the reman/end of life cores landed at sea, and if they have a bad landing they just get pushed off the deck into the ocean. The only time we will see F9 use is with the narrow window of missions that have no need of a heavier payload and can still be landed on the ground such as dragon missions. Not sure if I agree with the linkage to the tweet but upvote for a well thought out post.  I think the comment is around 'business focus': i.e. how much of a distraction is trying to make the upper stage re-usable versus concentrating effort on MCT. Whilst you can throw bodies at problems at the end of the day there will always be an overhead on Elon's and other management's time. This also isn't the first time he's commented on reusability of the upper stage also, and previous comments were in similar vein.",259,,0

That's totally unacceptable to just take advantage of your free charging.  If it continues press charges for trespassing. Leave a note. It is your establishment and let her know the charger is for emergencies and patrons only. Next time let her know you will have to call a tow truck. (harsh but it also isn't fair to you)   **Edit:**You can also remove it and get a charge point or something where they have to pay for it... Why so much text? How about: ""For customers of xxxxx only.""  And cut the power to any non-customers using it. That's a dick move right there (on her part).  I agree, kill switch. Run her off. They raised a good point.. Put up a sign that says please see the front desk if you wish to use the Destination Charger.. This way you can leave it off and only turn it on when you have actual patrons or emergencies that come in.. When they leave just ask them to let you know and you can kill the switch again. Flipping the breaker, in addition to the the fact that most standard breakers are not suppose to be used like a light switch, leaves the possibility that someone late at night not being able to charge if the breaker wasn't re-energized at the end of the day, I would feel really bad about not having it energized when someone needed it most. And even if I tried to tow her, from my understanding the charger cant be removed unless the key is near. So how could I really even get her towed. I'm positive no one in this area has a boot to put on a tire. You\'re not being mean. Tesla says that the destination charger program is for the benefit of your *mutual* customers. If she isn\'t your customer, she doesn\'t fall into that.  Now, some destination charger participants are kind enough to open their facilities up to the general public, but that\'s not necessary nor expected. Many, perhaps most, destination chargers are reserved for patrons only.  I\'d start with a sign that says ""customers only"" and see if that works, then escalate if it doesn\'t. So she came and got her car a bit ago, I also had the local sheriff there talking to me about what to do when she pulled up. Got a sob story about her apparently being split with her husband/spouse/BF whatever.  From the story I think she thought she could just park it there just like it was her own garage. I told her they make a 110V adapter so she can charge at her mothers house who's car she had shown up in.  She was pretty clueless about her car in general which I kinda had already know from my first 30 sec interaction.  I had already written her a note asking her not to come back unless she had worked something out with us. I don't think she'll be back honestly, but all this talk with you guys has me worried as a property owner. What if something happens again and need to remove a vehicle from my property??? I just got off the phone with Tesla roadside assistance and he said that they did not have the option to release the charger lock remotely.  So if someone parks their Tesla in my lone spot on the only charger I own for a day or two I can't move the car short of disconnecting the power and demounting the charger from the wall. This bothers me as a destination charging station and property owner. I agree with everyone else that this is abuse. However before taking drastic action I would consider if this woman might be misinformed. I once got scolded for using a private charger that was listed on PlugShare as being open 24/7 to the public. Of course I was apologetic when I learned of my misuse and I was careful to cease using it, but it had been a totally sincere mistake. This woman might be making a similar honest mistake where she heard or inferred bad information. Before towing her car or cutting power or changing your policies wholesale, I would start by leaving her a polite note telling her your charger is only for customers and emergencies and see if that does the trick. Don't panic it may very well be a one time occurrence. Just wanted to chime in and say you're totally justified in how you feel. Also thanks for installing a charger! Us owners really appreciate it! I like the idea of putting up a sign that encourages folks to come in and say hi, especially if you have a tour/tasting room type of business.

The New York Times discussed how this combination would help CEO Elon Musk move toward his aspirations for greater clean energy use. But the Los Angeles Times took the companies to task for merging in the face of tremendous capital needs at both, while Tesla was far short of hitting its goals for auto and battery production.   Since then the press has been almost wholly negative on the merger. Marketwatchs Barry Randall wrote that the deal makes no sense. He argues the companies are in two very different businesses that are not synergistic  and he analogizes this deal to GM buying Chevron. He also makes the case that SolarCity will likely go bankrupt, so there is no good reason for Tesla shareholders to bail out the company. And he argues that the capital requirements of the combined entities are unlikely to be fundable, even for its visionary CEO.  Fortune quotes legendary short seller Jim Chanos as saying the deal is crazy. He argues that SolarCity has an uneconomic business model based on his analysis of historical financial statements. And now Fortune is reporting that shareholder lawsuits to block the deal could delay, or kill, the merger.  But short-sellers are clearly not long-term investors. And there is a lot more ability for this deal to succeed and produce tremendous investor returns than anyone could ever glean from studying historical financial statements of both companies.  GM buying Chevron is entirely the wrong analogy to compare with Tesla buying SolarCity. Instead, compare this deal to what happened in the creation of television after General Sarnoff, who ran RCA, bought what he renamed NBC.  The world already had radio (just as we already have combustion powered cars). The conundrum was that nobody needed a TV, especially when there were no TV programs. But nobody would create TV programs if there were no consumers with TVs. General Sarnoff realized that both had to happen simultaneously  the creation of both demand, and supply. It would only be by the creation, and promotion, of both that television could be a success. And it was General Sarnoff who used this experience to launch the first color televisions at the same time as NBC launched the first color programming  which fairly quickly pushed the industry into color.   Skeptics think Mr. Musk and his companies are in over their heads, because there are manufacturing issues for the batteries and the cars, and the solar panel business has yet to be profitable. Yet, the older among us can recall all the troubles with launching TV.  Early sets were  not only expensive, they were often problematic, with frequent component failures causing owners to take the TV to a repairman. Often reception was poor, as people relied on poor antennas and weak network signals. It was common to turn on a set and have snow as we called it  images that were far from clear. And there was often that still image on the screen with the words Technical Difficulties, meaning that viewers just waited to see when programming would return. And programming was far from 24/7  and quality could be sketchy. But all these problems have been overcome by innovation across the industry.  Yes, the evolution of electric cars will involve a lot of ongoing innovation. So judging its likely success on the basis of recent history would be foolhardy. Today Tesla sells 100% of its cars, with no discounts. The market has said it really, really wants its vehicles. And everybody who is offered electric panels with (a) the opportunity to sell excess power back to the grid and (b) financing, takes the offer. People enjoy the low cost, sustainable electricity, and want it to grow. But lacking a good storage device, or the inability to sell excess power, their personal economics are more difficult.  Electricity production, electricity storage (batteries) and electricity consumption are tightly linked technologies.  Nobody will build charging stations if there are no electric cars.  Nobody will build electric cars if there are not good batteries.  Nobody will make better batteries if there are no electric cars. Nobody will install solar panels if they cant use all the electricity, or store what they dont immediately need (or sell it.)   This is not a world of an established marketplace, where GM and Chevron can stand alone. To grow the business requires a vision, business strategy and technical capability to put it all together. To make this work someone has to make progress in all the core technologies simultaneously  which will continue to improve the storage capability, quality and safety of the electric consuming automobiles, and the electric generating solar panels, as well as the storage capabilities associated with those panels and the creation of a new grid for distribution.  This is why Mr. Musk says that combining Tesla and SolarCity is obvious. Yes, he will have to raise huge sums of money.  So did such early pioneers as Vanderbilt (railways), Rockefeller (oil), Ford (autos), and Watson (computers). More recently, Steve Jobs of Apple became heroic for figuring out how to simultaneously create an iPhone, get a network to support the phone (his much maligned exclusive deal with AT&amp;T), getting developers to write enough apps for the phone to make it valuable, and creating the retail store to distribute those apps (iTunes). Without all those pieces, the ubiquitous iPhone would have been as successful as the Microsoft Zune.  It is fair for investors to worry if Tesla can raise enough money to pull this off. But, we dont know how creative Mr. Musk may become in organizing the resources and identifying investors. So far, Tesla has beaten all the skeptics who predicted failure based on price of the cars (Tesla has sold 100% of its production), lack of range (now up to nearly 300 miles), lack of charging network (Tesla built one itself) and charging time (now only 20 minutes). It would be shortsighted to think that the creativity which has made Tesla a success so far will suddenly disappear. And thus remarkably thoughtless to base an analysis on the industry as it exists today, rather than how it might well look in three, five and 10 years.  The combination of Tesla and SolarCity allows Tesla to have all the components to pursue greater future success. Investors with sufficient risk appetite are justified in supporting this merger because they will be positioned to receive the future rewards of this pioneering change in the auto and electric utility industries. At this moment (Sept 24, 2016):  * SolarCity ([SCTY]( is selling for **$19.24/share** * Tesla's ([TSLA]( offer is 0.11\\*207.45 = **$22.82/share**  So shares of SolarCity are selling for about 19% below what Tesla will pay for them if the shareholders approve the deal.  [You Really Don't Want to Make 150 Percent? Huh.](  The top Tesla shareholders are institutions[[1]( their votes will carry the most weight:  * Fidelity Management 13.8% * Baillie Gifford &amp; Co 8.8% * T. Rowe Price Associates 7.1% * Vanguard Group 3.3% All this chalks down to is what kind of investor you are. Do you invest for a profit this quarter? Or are you interested in some real, profitable change, regardless of whether it may take years to achieve?   As a society, the quarter to quarter capitalism that we're caught in is damaging. It's the primary cause of global warming, for one. Investors today know that cheap coal now = problems decades later, but they need to compete for *right now*.   Then again, how do we fix this? I'm led to believe that it's just a problem inherent with our economic system. We can't tell anyone that they can only compete on a long-term time frame, nor can we legislate that.    This is why this Tesla SolarCity buyout is a good thing. It forces the positive change that SolarCity would bring in a long time to be coupled with a company that people are willing to invest in *right now*. Here's to hoping it goes through with no problems. There are strong and interesting arguments for and against the merger, but Forbes sure chooses one of the weakest:   ""Compare this deal to what happened in the creation of television after General Sarnoff, who ran RCA, bought what he renamed NBC... The conundrum was that nobody needed a TV, especially when there were no TV programs. But nobody would create TV programs if there were no consumers with TVs.""  In other words, it\'s a chicken and egg problem - the electric car (and stationary storage) isn\'t viable without solar power, and solar power isn\'t viable without electric cars.   Huh? Tesla cars are obviously viable without solar power, and solar power is viable without electric cars. (same for stationary batteries - they can reduce the need for peaker plants, no matter if there is PV on the grid). Both rely on the existence of the electric utility industry, but that\'s been around for a century.   To sum up the article in two sentences ""Tesla and Solar City isn\'t like the auto and oil industries, where each one supports the other, it\'s like TV manufacturing and TV programming at TV\'s inceptions, where neither one worked without the other. Here\'s the evidence for why Tesla and Solar City support each other""  I just wish we could get more honest and insightful reporting on this stuff. What savings potential is there by putting all of these things on one inverter? How likely is an EV owner to have rooftop PV versus the population at large? How important is the data about solar power generation to making a good algorithm for managing batteries to maximize their dollar value, and can Tesla get that data by providing the inverter without doing the solar itself? What are the opportunity costs for Tesla in the deal - what else could they use the money for, and what advantages would it bring?  I\'m belaboring the point here, because it\'s a pet peeve of mine, weak but easy-to-make arguments that rely on people\'s interest in the company to get clicks, rather than cogent analysis that helps readers understand things. I guess we love Forbes again today... ###&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009;  Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, contractions, and other phrases which expand to something larger, that I\'ve seen in this thread:  |Fewer Letters|More Letters| |-------|---------| |[DC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/54ag10//d817w9x ""Used in this comment"")|Direct Current| |[FUD](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/54ag10//d81aqdq ""Used in this comment"")|Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt| |[SEC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/54ag10//d8ahgif ""Used in this comment"")|Securities and Exchange Commission| |[TSLA](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/54ag10//d80luyy ""Used in this comment"")|Stock ticker for Tesla Motors|  ---------------- ^(I\'m a bot, and I first saw this thread at 20th Oct 2016, 12:43 UTC.)

Tell me why the Chinese, now on a massive green energy spree, won't just steal the technology and dump  them out of the market, as they did with German solar businesses a decade ago.  23 state legislatures in the US are under full republican control, against just 8 democratic ones. What does this mean for tax incentives? How will any US state government react, when the company that fought it in its highest courts about a vendor issue comes back a few years later and wants to work on the states critical infrastructure?  Is it possible that a product in an individuals home can become part of one of &gt;  16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof.  That's from the department of homeland security, not me.  What if a powerwall isn't safe enough, in the face of state sponsored cyber attacks? It takes some fear mongering and a single law to make the resale of power from home illegal.  The problem is that too many factors in this business are way out of Elon Musks control, no matter how smart he is. What he would need to overcome this type of situation is a comfortable cash cushion and cash injections to scale this unique business anywhere on the planet. The opposite is the case. sorry *dude* no matter what you or any freakin *article* say this merger is bad for the bottom line.  For starters solar energy is going into one of the deepest recessions we've seen in the energy sector and production of photovoltaics are expected to cease completely by 2021...  Tesla itself is hemorrhaging money operating their superfactory in Fremont and they have yet to sell even one Tesla Model S in New Jersey, the state they have been fighting so hard to get sales rights in.    Elon Musk is too distracted with his hot wife and his work ethic leaves much to be desired.

Needs a few more days of refinement.""",7936,1762,606,Wednesday Prediction - Tesla Charging,36.0,62.0,"they said new Tesla product, right? in the discussion of charging, what about that snake charger thingy? Thats exactly what I'm thinking as well. They also filed a patent for an inter-protocol charging adapter:   And Tesla mentioned the idea a few times already: I think this could be it:   * Need something that can make cash for Tesla in short term to avoid capital raise in Q4 and Q1   * Supercharger credits are already built into MyTesla    * Quicker charging has been discussed.   * Add solar canopy option to offset some electricity costs and show the synergy of Tesla/Solar City.  Tesla may have a new supercharging station product that other companies can buy and install. Could charge Teslas super fast and other EV's at their max speed.   Tesla can lower the price of the S by $2,500 by unbundling super charging and reduce its own capital outlays for charging infrastructure.  Need to tweak the presentation to be very convincing for third parties to start buying charging infrastructure. This is my favorite candidate for the unveil.  It doesn't even have to be a fast DC charger either.  Just having more charging stations around would help relieve some pressure off the superchargers, so they can fulfill their main mission of making long trips feasible.  Plus providing property owners a method to gain revenue from the chargers will help more chargers get installed.  And every additional charger around can relieve the range anxiety for more potential EV drivers and get more of them on the road.  Definitely aligns with the Tesla mission.  Edit: Pushing the Tesla brand/logo in more areas wouldn't hurt on top of that. (Imagine that Tesla T sticking out of the top of a charging station similar to a GE Wattstation) I could see that.  I remember an article from a few months ago where Ruby Tuesday's wanted to do a franchise deal with Tesla. Very good hypothesis but I think the charger business plan innovations will ba announced at a later time.  But the gist of what you say is true. There are endless possibilities as to how Tesla could expand the charger network and even make money out of it. I don't think they'd want to give up one of their biggest advantages over the Bolt a year before the Model 3 even hits production. Maybe after the Model 3 is out there in numbers, but not before. Tesla tweeted that it was a ""New Product"".. not sure if this qualifies My prediction, inspired by yours: Swappable batteries. I know he demoed the capability way back, but now I think they are ready to make it real. Sub-15-minute swaps at superchargers that have the equipment (also, not free). I'm going way out of the box here and predicting a partnership with Apple. They've recently reduced their R&amp;D on a their own vehicle. Maybe they'll partner up with Tesla to work on a project for an even more consumer friendly vehicle coming in around 10k-20k. Whoa, just had a thought: this would be a shot across GM's bow as the Bolt is about to go on sale. And it won't have Supercharging. Tops out at 50 kW I believe? I'm holding out for a truck.   the drive assembly could also be used for a utility van.  with the new battery pack that might hit an attractive price point for fleet vehicles. Guys, this is probably the apartment complex solution tesla was talking about back in the day. Likely a bay you can install in the lot and any teslas will automatically drive to it to charge up then return to its parking spot. Pretty much exactly what I was thinking The fact that they called it a ""product"" leads me away from Superchargers because they don\'t charge for them, so it\'s not really a ""product"" per say.  I\'m thinking more along the lines of a larger battery or a larger Powerwall.",49,,0

The sun emits at any moment 3.86 x 10^ 26 watts   In other words Elon is a cyborg and feeds from the sun now it all makes sense. He needs 100 giga factories to power the whole world and be powered forever. My guesses:  * Powerwall 2.0 will allow you to select a percentage to devote to grid stabilization, and what percentage to emergency backup. The more you dedicate to grid stabilization, the more $$ you get from Tesla.  * Integrated two-way inverter allows Tesla to monitor the voltage sag, phase/frequency, and voltage spikes. Each battery installation is essentially a grid sensor, feeding data into the Tesla ~~hivemind~~ central server. Ditto with EVs during charging, as well as Supercharger installations. Data is king.  * If EV charging is involved, it will be with a direct DC feed to the car. A DC-DC converter (more efficient than DC-&gt;AC-&gt;DC) takes power directly from the solar panels or Powerwall and puts it into the vehicle battery. It can also charge your EV when the Powerwall battery is full, in places without net metering. Yet another use for the DC bypass ""Supercharger"" hardware. :D  * EV backup during power outages. Since it\'s hooked straight to the Powerwall, it has all the necessary grid safety interconnects for V2G. ""Zombie apocalypse"" proof system. A single DC-DC converter could conceivably be used for PV-&gt;Powerwall, Powerwall&lt;-&gt;grid, PV-&gt;car, Powerwall&lt;-&gt;car, and car&lt;-&gt;grid (since you\'re only doing one at a time), but they might use two instead. ***8:30 Eastern time - Event will start when this post is 10hrs old.***  You got this Musk. Roast the roofing insdustry.  edit: Rekt RemindMe! 9 hours I'm playing an orchestra concert that starts exactly when the event does :( Any suggestions on how to follow the unveiling after the fact without running into spoilers everywhere? I like the real-time suspense of keynote events... Will we have pricing after this event? Are there any guesses on what this will cost? 10K, 20K 30K? Does anyone have a link to where it will be streamed? You just wait. It's going to be cloudy. I see the application of solar roof, in regards to replacing shingles. What about the many houses in the west with clay or concrete tiles? I was told by a roofer that there was about 10 tons of material on my roof. Just the removal cost of that is going to be very expensive. Though I would love to get rid of that weight, and the heat sink. Every time I go into the attic I am amazed at what little is holding up all that weight. On top of my head!   Then again without the weight and the fact that the foundation is a slab poured with no footing, I suppose the wind could blow the house sideways Xd  note: Mid 90s tract home Phoenix I hoping there is a product that will allow me to bend over my power company and my solar hating legislature and corporation commission. Where is the web cast showing? FYI, according to  a typical asphalt shingle roof rated for 20 years costs $1.22 per sq ft, and a roof rated 40 years costs $2.07 per sq ft.  (This excludes removal, disposal costs, and labor costs as these would likely be comparable between a solar product and shingles.)  If prices are announced tonight, this should give a decent idea of cost comparison. ###&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009;  Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, contractions, and other phrases which expand to something larger, that I\'ve seen in this thread:  |Fewer Letters|More Letters| |-------|---------|---| |[AC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9dn3zb ""Last usage"")|Air Conditioning| | |Alternating Current| |[AP](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9c8qsa ""Last usage"")|AutoPilot (semi-autonomous vehicle control)| |[DC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9dujfp ""Last usage"")|Direct Current| |[HPWC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9dh62g ""Last usage"")|High-Power Wall Charger, available for separate purchase; up to 80A charging| |[P100DL](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9ci4vx ""Last usage"")|100kWh battery, dual motors, performance and Ludicrous upgrades| |[TSLA](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9c8le4 ""Last usage"")|Stock ticker for Tesla Motors| |[Wh](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9c8gvn ""Last usage"")|Watt-Hour, unit of energy| |[kW](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9ci4vx ""Last usage"")|Kilowatt, unit of power| |[kWh](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9dy9hm ""Last usage"")|Kilowatt-hours, electrical energy unit (3.6MJ)|  ---------------- ^(I\'m a bot, and I first saw this thread at 28th Oct 2016, 21:38 UTC.)   ^(I\'ve seen 9 acronyms in this thread; )[^the ^most ^compressed ^thread ^commented ^on ^today](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/5bt3mg)^( has 6 acronyms.)

(This isn't a slight against anyone, I hope this is a really good announcement for the company) Mandatory timezone converter: shaping out to be a lovely afternoon in burbank today. no more chance if rain. Fair enough. Thought you were suggesting that the roof itself would be paid off as well. I can see the differential between a regular roof and a solar roof being paid off in about 5 years. The Stream is Up - [Powerwall 2 BY TESLA](  Edit:- [Tesla will be taking orders soon]( Streaming is live, with countdown clock: If anyone is there, and is able to ask a question, perhaps ask if Tesla/SolarCity/Elon has any comments about solar in states that have unfriendly solar legislation that has prevented Solarcity from operating in the past.  Example Florida. Tesla FM plays a mashup of 80s and dance music....this deeply pleases me.   Edit: added words to reflect the current music :P Any youtube link for the presentation? Suggestion: start an IRC chat for live chatting during unveiling? Looks like they're holding the event on the set of Desperate Housewives: This 80's remix is rockin'  Seems they removed the countdown... This music mix is top notch. Andddd, we're delayed....! 5:32 already and it hasn't started Elon is official late Is anyone actually surprised that the event is delayed? Looks like the sun can't even stop Musk from being on time It's 1:30am here in the UK and I have to get up for work in 5 hours, but by God I'm not missing this. Charlie Brown and the football every time. ""Sharp"" some Daft Punk style music playing as we wait for the event to start Whats this song? Sunset is around 6:13ish... Maybe Musk is listening and is saying ""Don\'t start. This is my jam."" Anybody know who does that, ""You know I work all day just to sleep all night."" song that just played? [Photos of the new shingles]( (Courtesy of Teslarati's Twitter feed) I don't think Elon is late, but people are still settling in. couple more minutes, Musk was delayed from the airport I wonder if it already started, and they just forgot to start the live stream...as I typed this, someone just stated it's starting in 4 minutes on the live feed (8:39PM EST) Just a few minutes to go. They said they're waiting for folks who arrived late to get situated. ""Let the people who are few minutes late to get here""  So Elon?  kidding...maybe There was just a voice announcement over the music but I missed it. I think it was just apologizing for the delay.   Did anyone catch it? Tweet:  Elon Musk \u200f@elonmusk  18 seconds ago: Pushing start to ~5:45 to allow more people to arrive Elon Musk via Twitter:  Pushed to 5:45 to allow more people to arrive. It's past 5:30... Elon Musk \u200f@elonmusk  Pushing start to ~5:45 to allow more people to arrive 5:30 sharp, right .... Anyone able to identify the music or let me know where I can find it? &gt;Pushing start to ~5:45 to allow more people to arrive 5.30 sharp &gt; Elon says that it will start on time   It's 5:40pm PDT, and the video hasn't started. Maybe Elon can ask God to delay the sunset for him? Tesla just tweeted that we should tune in at 5:45 to ""see what the future is like"" Anyone know a good IRC web client we can all jump in while we wait?  EDIT: Screw it, jump in here if anyone wants to watch and chat at the same time:  #TeslaReddit Finally!! here we go!! Here we go Looks like the roof to the right was the solar roof, it was shiny NO Jacket! Haha! ELON JUST MADE A VELVET JACKET JOKE!! An Elon presentation wouldn't be the same without the nervous stuttering Fuck my stream is dying, anyone else having problems? I like how Elon just totally skipped all the slides they had about the CO2 problem and just jumped to ""we need to make solar roofs!"" stream is so blurry, thought the man on the left facing the camera was yawning continuously. this made me change the quality to 1080 haha ""Save us Elon!"" Hahah ""Save us Elon""   I lol\'ed...too true. This is basically Tesla's iPhone announcement. That graph! He's sure putting on the pounds. Stream is awful, why not host a 2nd on youtube? Where is this being filmed at? Are those like real houses or are they all models? ""solar roofs really arent that complicated"" Stream keeps freezing!! help yah... im gona wait for proper hosting. This stream sucks so much. Are they using a 56k connection to upload it? Join us in IRC during the announcement:   ..#TeslaReddit I'm not having streaming problems, working fine for me.  Maybe it's just Elon's usually stuttering? Triples electric use:  1/3rd for heating, 1/3rd for transportation, and 1/3rd for other (mostly existing) electric. Powerwall 2 has 14 kWh capacity for $5,500 ""Special Snowflake Tile"" Roadster in the garage! Model 3 Prototype Summon! :) surprise model 3??? a Model 3! That model 3 though Model 3! I love the powerwheels model S at one of the houses Is that a Model 3 on house number 4? The tuscan shingled one? OH MAN.   Edit: Compared to other presentations given by Elon, this one was much better. I think he went off script a bit but it was short and to the point mostly which is much better compared to the Model 3 presentation.   Also can't wait for the youtube where we can ogle the Model 3 some more. Dam those tiles survived that weight drop... Would not have guessed that a glass tile would be stronger than existing roofing materials. What about places where it snows is my question? Leaving us hanging! What about the price, power output...? So what's the cost? How do they install? any idea on the cost per tile? Uhhhhhh, pricing? That seems like the most important thing to cover. No Q and A session? is that it? I assume we will get the technical details on the website shortly. textured glass is hard to clean, is it not? So whats the best option for someone with a flat roof? Any ideas with how this would work for HOA restrictions? cell efficiency, price, warranty, when they will be available? has anyone found that block on google maps yet? i want to see street view haha wow, he did it again.  crazy.  just crazy. Very light on the specs - that's a shame. Looks great though! He didn't touch on the price. I feel that the price is make or break for a product like this.   I have my reservations on if it is really comparable to the price of a new roof. I would guess $40-50k for this, which is way too much for the majority of consumers. What is the song they played after the presentation ended? Can the battery put out enough power to run my 240v hot tub after sunset? Anyone have a link to the presentation? I was reading SpaceX stuff and lost track of time D: I want to watch it without having stuff spoiled for me but not seeing it posted yet :(  Edit: Phew it's replaying! Wow he really didn't go into anything.  Considering the merger is impending and his teasing tweets leading up, we got nothing but price and specs of power wall and the look of their shingle. Ok, so many questions. They didn't discuss price, other than saying it would be affordable. Also, even if the material is affordable, I bet the installation is MUCH more expensive. Also, what about air vents for the attic. What about air vents for plumbing. How could those possibly be cut in. How is the current going to be conducted from all the solar shingles to the battery and inverter etc. And etc, etc etc Looks really great, but I expected more from today. What is the power output? Pricing? Tell us about the inverter. etc. Jeez it just sorta ended.  When is it available? How much does it cost? How do the panels connect? Will there be a network of 50-million wires? Does Powerwall 2.0 include inverter? Maybe he just teasing us before merge? Well, looks like it went pretty much how I predicted it [earlier](  - Alright   - Welcome everyone, w-welcome to tonight's event   - So, why are we doing this?   - I can't stress this enough   - It's a super-hard problem - An order of magnitude higher, at least   - It's like, we've got this really huge fusion reactor in the sky, that's gonna be there for a long time   - At a super-high velocity   - So, um... Anyway, here's Tesla Roof So I'm a little late to the party, the only info I've found is the new powerwall is 14kWh and $5,500. What else did we learn? I'm very underwhelmed right now...    Edit: Okay, I was able to watch the presentation and I'm feeling a little better about it now. The before and after pictures of the roofs were actually really cool, much more impressive than I expected. And the fact that they have several styles is awesome, and obviously will be really key if this is going to become a thing. Plenty of details left but the concept looks like it could be a real game changer.    20 million roofs installed worldwide per year is a big number. On the high end a traditional roof is about $1K, and on the low end annual electric cost in the US is $1K. Elon said the Tesla Roof will end up cheaper than traditional + electric costs. So if you assume a 10 year break even you're looking at $11K for the solar roof. If they get 5% of the market thats 1 million roofs/year at $10K/roof bringing in $10,000,000,000 in revenue. Obviously these are crazy rough numbers(i.e., wrong), but it gives some sense of the economics and it certainly seems like there's potential there. &gt;44"" / 1150mm 29"" / 755mm 5.5"" / 155mm &gt; &gt;Usable Capacity 13.5 kWh &gt; &gt;Depth of Discharge 100% &gt; &gt;Efficiency 90% round-trip &gt; &gt;Power 7kW peak / 5kW continuous &gt; &gt;Supported Applications Solar self-consumption Time of use load shifting Backup Off grid &gt; &gt;Warranty 10 years &gt; &gt;Scalable Up to 9 Powerwalls &gt; &gt;Operating Temperature -4 to 122F / -20C to 50C &gt; &gt;Dimensions L x W x D: 44"" x 29"" x 5.5"" (1150mm x 755mm x 155mm) &gt; &gt;Weight 264.4 lb / 110 kg &gt; &gt;Installation Floor or wall mounted Indoor or outdoor &gt; &gt;Certification UL and IEC certified Grid code compliant Man, not available until September (power wall v2)? 11 months and we'll be off the grid!

Very unlike Elon to not get into the numbers. Very strange he was rushing the entire presentation and I was thinking he wanted to hit some specific time when the sun angled but then he ran off stage like he had somewhere to be. Very strange. I always wonder why the audience mic is kept up. Solar City's website has a little more info  - Has a sign up for the waitlist; production stated to begin mid-2017  - Powerwall 2 listed at an extra $48/month when combined with a solar installation Anyone notice the model 3 in the garage in the promo image for the solar roof? Elon presented a vision of what the future of Tesla/SolaCity holds and I like it. Powerwall order agreement: Website on Solar City is up about the roof: So... textured glass tiles. How grippy will they be to walk on? Didn't mention, efficiency, pricing, installation, instillation. So this is Tesla glass? Eh? Press Release:  #energy I just was in a live chat with a Solar City rep. on Solar City's website and he said that he believes pricing information will be out Monday but he was not 100% on that. How long ago do you think they installed the panels?  Do you think they are waiting on real world data before releasing power output, etc.  Anybody know when the Universal backlot tour was closed recently? There was a Q&amp;A after that wasn't streamed is the powerwall compatible with other solar panels? is 5,500$ for 14 kwh a decent price? Did anyone notice the [rims on the Model S?]( They don't seem to be on the design studio. More images and info here: &gt; And for those asking, no formal pricing was announced for the solar roof.

But of course, to be a real game changer, the Chinese must pick up on the entire concept systematically, copy it, and make it way cheaper because of Chinese government subsidies until it causes trade wars between trading bloc and then we will see wide adoption worldwide.   I know this sucks for the US to have its innovation copied. But if you rely on Tesla alone to implement this system worldwide to reverse climate change, it wouldn't be enough.  We need the Chinese do what they did to solar panels with this tech: make it so cheap that the system is to be implemented all over the globe (at least for industrialised countries).

I'm a bot working hard to help Redditors find related videos to watch. *** [Play All]( | [Info]( | Get it on [Chrome]( / [Firefox]( This sucks!  I just had my house built brand new 5 years ago and the design is just like the italian home on the demo pics.  That roof would have been lovely.  And we have a 20kw generator that is powered by propane.  Hey, it was top at the time.  Now I feel a bit behind.... Since the solar roof is dependent on the merger I'm not expecting to  hear much in terms of pricing, availability, and specs for a while.  The Powerwall 2 has double the energy density of the Powerwall 1 and a built-in inverter.   I'm really curious about this inverter and if and Tesla will offer a stand alone unit. This is where the event was held. [34.139186, -118.345138]( I was really hoping they would show the energy production of the demo houses they had. It was a great presentation but a lot of details were left out. Anyone saved the webcast or have a link to kt? I was originally going to vote my Tesla shares against the merger, but now that I've seen what Elon Musk has planned for *his* SolarCity, I've changed my mind and will now vote my shares for the merger.  The solar roofs look straight-up amazing. Absolutely incredible. This is pretty amazing stuff. Anyone have a link that can direct me to costs? I'm actually in the market for a new roof and will definitely want to go this option. This is a pretty amazing opportunity. Say you have $140000 to spend on a car, it would be much better to buy 9 powerwalls (126 kWh with 63 kW delivery) for $50500, a maxed out options Model 3 at around $50000 and the rest to buy solar roof. For the price of a P100DL you could now instead opt for a slightly less performing car but with a 15-30 years worth of zero emissions energy for the car and the house paid in advance. I don\'t know about you but I\'d take that deal. I\'m not going to say anything against those that opt to buy the more expensive cars, I\'m just pointing out that if they don\'t partake on energy storage and generation, they\'re not really doing as much as they could to support the transition to sustainable energy production and transportation. Plus, don\'t you just hate when a vile, ignorant, repulsive person just says in an annoying voice ""Yeah, but your electric car pollutes more cause the electricity is produced by coal power plants"". Now anyone can do something about it and tell them to shut the fuck up. So the powerwall 2 is 14 KWhr of storage. If the model 3 is a 60 KWhr battery (and gets 200 miles of range) thats roughly 46 miles of range stored in the home. You're gonna need a couple of them if you want to power a home and still charge your car(s) overnight. At $5,500 per pack its still an expensive proposition. u/FredTesla please write an article on comparing the powerwall 2.0 to a generator, let's say a mikano 13kva. Whose houses were those? This is another tripple down strategy by Tesla. First focus on those with the spending capabilities in an early go to market face and through the years scale in a way that it is in reach for the middle class. I think this will succeed big time. Looks great!  I'm skeptical of tesla math on the cost. As someone who is currently in the framing stages of his new house this really gets me down as I won't be able to utilize the product.  I will be putting solar on the roof regardless, but this product looks great. The one thing I can't find anywhere is any pre-wire info for the old power wall or this new one. This new one seems to have everything including the inverter, so how does one preside for it - is there a min amount of solar required/max number (i.e. Is inverter size also 7kW, so put 7kW of solar on the roof?  Does Tye powerwall connect to the grid via a breaker in your panel?  I want to pre-wore my house to have the powerwall. Do what's the ultimate plan here? Solar roof to generate power, and the power wall stores extra and tries to supply your house when the solar roof isn't generating enough? There is zero information on the website. Some questions, in case anybody knows...  - rainwater harvesting is crucial for us (we have a metal roof for this), will these panels allow direct use of the water without treatment?  - will these shatter if a tree branch gets blown onto the roof?  - estimated power output per sq.metre?  - wiring?  - cost? Someone needs to discuss all of the practical details of this.  Obviously, I'm approaching this from the position of enthusiasm for such a product, but the literal roof is an area of a home that shouldn't be messed around with.  This needs to be incredibly reliable.  - Reliability is a huge concern (as is installation).  What are the installation details for a product like this?  Existing roof is stripped, then what?  Is some type of moisture barrier applied and then shingles installed? - How is this product serviced?  Is SolarCity responsible for the end-to-end of this?  Am I entirely at the mercy of SolarCity?  It doesn't seem like I would be able to ask a regular roofing company for any kind of servicing or installation.  I'm nervous about SolarCity being gone in 30 years and my solar roof being compromised. - What about everything else that's commonly found on a roof?  I have brick masonry chimneys.  Obviously, a mason will need the ability to walk around on the roof to do basic tuckpointing.  Can I trust regular contractors to walk around on my solar shingles? - What if my new solar roof leaks?   - Are the shingles slippery?  As a regular homeowner, can I get up on the roof to do basic things like clean leaves off?  I feel quite nervous about entrusting my entire house to an emerging piece of tech.  I'm concerned about reliability, leaking, maintenance, lock-in.  If SolarCity fucks up something, I can't call someone else, and the roof is critical.  At least with separate solar paneling I'm not risking the integrity of my house. I would like to know if they have had any full installation roofs (prototypes or final production level) sitting on a roof for a full year, in all climate types, so we can have a real-world sense of their performance, reliability and durability.  A roof protects your largest investment. If this new product is essentially just a ""Beta"" roof and is found to have issues, I doubt Tesla is likely to sweep into your home and fix any damage. So I want a bit of reassurance that they\'ve been real-world testing and tweaking this product and are sure it is at least as good as - if not better - than current roof systems. What did that guy in the beginning say to Elon that got everyone laughing? Can someone check if my math is correct?    &amp;nbsp;  Powerwall analysis for me (SCE Utility So Cal).   Peak kwh: .42   Non peak kwh: .11    &amp;nbsp;  No solar option (charge at night, use during day):   14 kwh x .31 cent savings x 365 days = 1584.1 annual savings   $6500 cost / 1584.1 =  4.1 year payback    &amp;nbsp;  Solar option (charge daytime, use at night):   14kwh x .11 kwh (non peak rate) x 365 days = 562.1   $6500 cost / 562.1 = 11.6 year payback Where is this neighborhood? Are these houses owned by the company?  edit: Found my my answer, [Universal Studios]( where they filmed desperate housewives Solar tiles have been out [for a while]( What's new about these? With the merger vote upcoming, Elon has every reason to release positive information on the solar/battery side of the business. That makes the absence of information worrying.   Things I want to know:  Pricing. What's the $/Watt and $/sq ft in material costs and in installation? The statement that it is competitive with other roofing gives tons of wiggle room - is it competitive with cheap asphalt roofing or top of the line roofing? Is that assuming 5 years at average solar prices, typical sunlight, or 30 years with no shadow on a south facing roof in southern California?  Inverter. Can it use the powerwall's inverter? Does Tesla make an inverter for it, or 3rd party?  Wiring. How do the tiles connect?  Installation. Who does it, how complicated is it?  Software. How does the powerwall choose when to charge and when to discharge in a grid tied system? How nicely does that integrate with solar hardware and software?  Until we have that information, most of all the price, it's really hard to say 1) how good this product is, and 2) whether it makes sense for Tesla to be doing it themselves. Assuming I don't need more than about 8 hours of backup, PW2 now seems competitive with a proper standby generator. I don't mean the noisy smelly little Honda, I mean the permanent box on a concrete pad thing.  The roof thing...TBD...I can't find any meaningful specs for it. Okay so here is the single biggest question  How does the system fix the biggest issue with being a string-inverter system? Namely, if any panels are in the shade it reduces the entire series to that level of power. This is why microinverters are normally better. But we know this is likely to be a string inverter because the inverter is built into the new powerwall.   I'm sure musk has some sort of fix. My best guess? Each column of cells (assuming they attach that way) can independently connect and disconnect from the system. The system real-time monitors each column and calculates the highest power output either through having the hit from the shade, or having all cells operate at a higher power with the shaded ones merely disconnected. Does anyone have any idea how the financing would work?  We will be building a new house, so would I have to contract separately for the roof and then have a separate payment for that? What was the little tiny Tesla? Is the new Powerwall really that much more economical? Didnt the original powerwall store 7KWh and cost 3k? now this is 14KWH for 5.5k. Thats just a $500 discount on 2 old units no? Am I missing something? Haven't had time to watch it-do we know when the tiles are coming out?",1687,"He's now 5 minutes late already :) Autonomous cars and rockets to Mars, but can't keep a stream running. Wow Elon Musk sucks at public speaking Listening to Elon struggle to get out a string of sentences is torture.  He's no doubt an amazing guy, but he sucks at public speaking. FFS Elon   &gt;Trom above, the solar cells ...  Spell check.  Do you have it?",14

The sun emits at any moment 3.86 x 10^ 26 watts   In other words Elon is a cyborg and feeds from the sun now it all makes sense. He needs 100 giga factories to power the whole world and be powered forever. My guesses:  * Powerwall 2.0 will allow you to select a percentage to devote to grid stabilization, and what percentage to emergency backup. The more you dedicate to grid stabilization, the more $$ you get from Tesla.  * Integrated two-way inverter allows Tesla to monitor the voltage sag, phase/frequency, and voltage spikes. Each battery installation is essentially a grid sensor, feeding data into the Tesla ~~hivemind~~ central server. Ditto with EVs during charging, as well as Supercharger installations. Data is king.  * If EV charging is involved, it will be with a direct DC feed to the car. A DC-DC converter (more efficient than DC-&gt;AC-&gt;DC) takes power directly from the solar panels or Powerwall and puts it into the vehicle battery. It can also charge your EV when the Powerwall battery is full, in places without net metering. Yet another use for the DC bypass ""Supercharger"" hardware. :D  * EV backup during power outages. Since it\'s hooked straight to the Powerwall, it has all the necessary grid safety interconnects for V2G. ""Zombie apocalypse"" proof system. A single DC-DC converter could conceivably be used for PV-&gt;Powerwall, Powerwall&lt;-&gt;grid, PV-&gt;car, Powerwall&lt;-&gt;car, and car&lt;-&gt;grid (since you\'re only doing one at a time), but they might use two instead. ***8:30 Eastern time - Event will start when this post is 10hrs old.***  You got this Musk. Roast the roofing insdustry.  edit: Rekt RemindMe! 9 hours I'm playing an orchestra concert that starts exactly when the event does :( Any suggestions on how to follow the unveiling after the fact without running into spoilers everywhere? I like the real-time suspense of keynote events... Will we have pricing after this event? Are there any guesses on what this will cost? 10K, 20K 30K? Does anyone have a link to where it will be streamed? You just wait. It's going to be cloudy. I see the application of solar roof, in regards to replacing shingles. What about the many houses in the west with clay or concrete tiles? I was told by a roofer that there was about 10 tons of material on my roof. Just the removal cost of that is going to be very expensive. Though I would love to get rid of that weight, and the heat sink. Every time I go into the attic I am amazed at what little is holding up all that weight. On top of my head!   Then again without the weight and the fact that the foundation is a slab poured with no footing, I suppose the wind could blow the house sideways Xd  note: Mid 90s tract home Phoenix I hoping there is a product that will allow me to bend over my power company and my solar hating legislature and corporation commission. Where is the web cast showing? FYI, according to  a typical asphalt shingle roof rated for 20 years costs $1.22 per sq ft, and a roof rated 40 years costs $2.07 per sq ft.  (This excludes removal, disposal costs, and labor costs as these would likely be comparable between a solar product and shingles.)  If prices are announced tonight, this should give a decent idea of cost comparison. ###&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009;  Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, contractions, and other phrases which expand to something larger, that I\'ve seen in this thread:  |Fewer Letters|More Letters| |-------|---------|---| |[AC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9dn3zb ""Last usage"")|Air Conditioning| | |Alternating Current| |[AP](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9c8qsa ""Last usage"")|AutoPilot (semi-autonomous vehicle control)| |[DC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9dujfp ""Last usage"")|Direct Current| |[HPWC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9dh62g ""Last usage"")|High-Power Wall Charger, available for separate purchase; up to 80A charging| |[P100DL](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9ci4vx ""Last usage"")|100kWh battery, dual motors, performance and Ludicrous upgrades| |[TSLA](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9c8le4 ""Last usage"")|Stock ticker for Tesla Motors| |[Wh](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9c8gvn ""Last usage"")|Watt-Hour, unit of energy| |[kW](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9ci4vx ""Last usage"")|Kilowatt, unit of power| |[kWh](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/59ulag//d9dy9hm ""Last usage"")|Kilowatt-hours, electrical energy unit (3.6MJ)|  ---------------- ^(I\'m a bot, and I first saw this thread at 28th Oct 2016, 21:38 UTC.)   ^(I\'ve seen 9 acronyms in this thread; )[^the ^most ^compressed ^thread ^commented ^on ^today](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/5bt3mg)^( has 6 acronyms.)

(This isn't a slight against anyone, I hope this is a really good announcement for the company) Mandatory timezone converter: shaping out to be a lovely afternoon in burbank today. no more chance if rain. Fair enough. Thought you were suggesting that the roof itself would be paid off as well. I can see the differential between a regular roof and a solar roof being paid off in about 5 years. The Stream is Up - [Powerwall 2 BY TESLA](  Edit:- [Tesla will be taking orders soon]( Streaming is live, with countdown clock: If anyone is there, and is able to ask a question, perhaps ask if Tesla/SolarCity/Elon has any comments about solar in states that have unfriendly solar legislation that has prevented Solarcity from operating in the past.  Example Florida. Tesla FM plays a mashup of 80s and dance music....this deeply pleases me.   Edit: added words to reflect the current music :P Any youtube link for the presentation? Suggestion: start an IRC chat for live chatting during unveiling? Looks like they're holding the event on the set of Desperate Housewives: This 80's remix is rockin'  Seems they removed the countdown... This music mix is top notch. Andddd, we're delayed....! 5:32 already and it hasn't started Elon is official late Is anyone actually surprised that the event is delayed? Looks like the sun can't even stop Musk from being on time It's 1:30am here in the UK and I have to get up for work in 5 hours, but by God I'm not missing this. Charlie Brown and the football every time. ""Sharp"" some Daft Punk style music playing as we wait for the event to start Whats this song? Sunset is around 6:13ish... Maybe Musk is listening and is saying ""Don\'t start. This is my jam."" Anybody know who does that, ""You know I work all day just to sleep all night."" song that just played? [Photos of the new shingles]( (Courtesy of Teslarati's Twitter feed) I don't think Elon is late, but people are still settling in. couple more minutes, Musk was delayed from the airport I wonder if it already started, and they just forgot to start the live stream...as I typed this, someone just stated it's starting in 4 minutes on the live feed (8:39PM EST) Just a few minutes to go. They said they're waiting for folks who arrived late to get situated. ""Let the people who are few minutes late to get here""  So Elon?  kidding...maybe There was just a voice announcement over the music but I missed it. I think it was just apologizing for the delay.   Did anyone catch it? Tweet:  Elon Musk \u200f@elonmusk  18 seconds ago: Pushing start to ~5:45 to allow more people to arrive Elon Musk via Twitter:  Pushed to 5:45 to allow more people to arrive. It's past 5:30... Elon Musk \u200f@elonmusk  Pushing start to ~5:45 to allow more people to arrive 5:30 sharp, right .... Anyone able to identify the music or let me know where I can find it? &gt;Pushing start to ~5:45 to allow more people to arrive 5.30 sharp &gt; Elon says that it will start on time   It's 5:40pm PDT, and the video hasn't started. Maybe Elon can ask God to delay the sunset for him? Tesla just tweeted that we should tune in at 5:45 to ""see what the future is like"" Anyone know a good IRC web client we can all jump in while we wait?  EDIT: Screw it, jump in here if anyone wants to watch and chat at the same time:  #TeslaReddit Finally!! here we go!! Here we go Looks like the roof to the right was the solar roof, it was shiny NO Jacket! Haha! ELON JUST MADE A VELVET JACKET JOKE!! An Elon presentation wouldn't be the same without the nervous stuttering Fuck my stream is dying, anyone else having problems? I like how Elon just totally skipped all the slides they had about the CO2 problem and just jumped to ""we need to make solar roofs!"" stream is so blurry, thought the man on the left facing the camera was yawning continuously. this made me change the quality to 1080 haha ""Save us Elon!"" Hahah ""Save us Elon""   I lol\'ed...too true. This is basically Tesla's iPhone announcement. That graph! He's sure putting on the pounds. Stream is awful, why not host a 2nd on youtube? Where is this being filmed at? Are those like real houses or are they all models? ""solar roofs really arent that complicated"" Stream keeps freezing!! help yah... im gona wait for proper hosting. This stream sucks so much. Are they using a 56k connection to upload it? Join us in IRC during the announcement:   ..#TeslaReddit I'm not having streaming problems, working fine for me.  Maybe it's just Elon's usually stuttering? Triples electric use:  1/3rd for heating, 1/3rd for transportation, and 1/3rd for other (mostly existing) electric. Powerwall 2 has 14 kWh capacity for $5,500 ""Special Snowflake Tile"" Roadster in the garage! Model 3 Prototype Summon! :) surprise model 3??? a Model 3! That model 3 though Model 3! I love the powerwheels model S at one of the houses Is that a Model 3 on house number 4? The tuscan shingled one? OH MAN.   Edit: Compared to other presentations given by Elon, this one was much better. I think he went off script a bit but it was short and to the point mostly which is much better compared to the Model 3 presentation.   Also can't wait for the youtube where we can ogle the Model 3 some more. Dam those tiles survived that weight drop... Would not have guessed that a glass tile would be stronger than existing roofing materials. What about places where it snows is my question? Leaving us hanging! What about the price, power output...? So what's the cost? How do they install? any idea on the cost per tile? Uhhhhhh, pricing? That seems like the most important thing to cover. No Q and A session? is that it? I assume we will get the technical details on the website shortly. textured glass is hard to clean, is it not? So whats the best option for someone with a flat roof? Any ideas with how this would work for HOA restrictions? cell efficiency, price, warranty, when they will be available? has anyone found that block on google maps yet? i want to see street view haha wow, he did it again.  crazy.  just crazy. Very light on the specs - that's a shame. Looks great though! He didn't touch on the price. I feel that the price is make or break for a product like this.   I have my reservations on if it is really comparable to the price of a new roof. I would guess $40-50k for this, which is way too much for the majority of consumers. What is the song they played after the presentation ended? Can the battery put out enough power to run my 240v hot tub after sunset? Anyone have a link to the presentation? I was reading SpaceX stuff and lost track of time D: I want to watch it without having stuff spoiled for me but not seeing it posted yet :(  Edit: Phew it's replaying! Wow he really didn't go into anything.  Considering the merger is impending and his teasing tweets leading up, we got nothing but price and specs of power wall and the look of their shingle. Ok, so many questions. They didn't discuss price, other than saying it would be affordable. Also, even if the material is affordable, I bet the installation is MUCH more expensive. Also, what about air vents for the attic. What about air vents for plumbing. How could those possibly be cut in. How is the current going to be conducted from all the solar shingles to the battery and inverter etc. And etc, etc etc Looks really great, but I expected more from today. What is the power output? Pricing? Tell us about the inverter. etc. Jeez it just sorta ended.  When is it available? How much does it cost? How do the panels connect? Will there be a network of 50-million wires? Does Powerwall 2.0 include inverter? Maybe he just teasing us before merge? Well, looks like it went pretty much how I predicted it [earlier](  - Alright   - Welcome everyone, w-welcome to tonight's event   - So, why are we doing this?   - I can't stress this enough   - It's a super-hard problem - An order of magnitude higher, at least   - It's like, we've got this really huge fusion reactor in the sky, that's gonna be there for a long time   - At a super-high velocity   - So, um... Anyway, here's Tesla Roof So I'm a little late to the party, the only info I've found is the new powerwall is 14kWh and $5,500. What else did we learn? I'm very underwhelmed right now...    Edit: Okay, I was able to watch the presentation and I'm feeling a little better about it now. The before and after pictures of the roofs were actually really cool, much more impressive than I expected. And the fact that they have several styles is awesome, and obviously will be really key if this is going to become a thing. Plenty of details left but the concept looks like it could be a real game changer.    20 million roofs installed worldwide per year is a big number. On the high end a traditional roof is about $1K, and on the low end annual electric cost in the US is $1K. Elon said the Tesla Roof will end up cheaper than traditional + electric costs. So if you assume a 10 year break even you're looking at $11K for the solar roof. If they get 5% of the market thats 1 million roofs/year at $10K/roof bringing in $10,000,000,000 in revenue. Obviously these are crazy rough numbers(i.e., wrong), but it gives some sense of the economics and it certainly seems like there's potential there. &gt;44"" / 1150mm 29"" / 755mm 5.5"" / 155mm &gt; &gt;Usable Capacity 13.5 kWh &gt; &gt;Depth of Discharge 100% &gt; &gt;Efficiency 90% round-trip &gt; &gt;Power 7kW peak / 5kW continuous &gt; &gt;Supported Applications Solar self-consumption Time of use load shifting Backup Off grid &gt; &gt;Warranty 10 years &gt; &gt;Scalable Up to 9 Powerwalls &gt; &gt;Operating Temperature -4 to 122F / -20C to 50C &gt; &gt;Dimensions L x W x D: 44"" x 29"" x 5.5"" (1150mm x 755mm x 155mm) &gt; &gt;Weight 264.4 lb / 110 kg &gt; &gt;Installation Floor or wall mounted Indoor or outdoor &gt; &gt;Certification UL and IEC certified Grid code compliant Man, not available until September (power wall v2)? 11 months and we'll be off the grid!

Very unlike Elon to not get into the numbers. Very strange he was rushing the entire presentation and I was thinking he wanted to hit some specific time when the sun angled but then he ran off stage like he had somewhere to be. Very strange. I always wonder why the audience mic is kept up. Solar City's website has a little more info  - Has a sign up for the waitlist; production stated to begin mid-2017  - Powerwall 2 listed at an extra $48/month when combined with a solar installation Anyone notice the model 3 in the garage in the promo image for the solar roof? Elon presented a vision of what the future of Tesla/SolaCity holds and I like it. Powerwall order agreement: Website on Solar City is up about the roof: So... textured glass tiles. How grippy will they be to walk on? Didn't mention, efficiency, pricing, installation, instillation. So this is Tesla glass? Eh? Press Release:  #energy I just was in a live chat with a Solar City rep. on Solar City's website and he said that he believes pricing information will be out Monday but he was not 100% on that. How long ago do you think they installed the panels?  Do you think they are waiting on real world data before releasing power output, etc.  Anybody know when the Universal backlot tour was closed recently? There was a Q&amp;A after that wasn't streamed is the powerwall compatible with other solar panels? is 5,500$ for 14 kwh a decent price? Did anyone notice the [rims on the Model S?]( They don't seem to be on the design studio. More images and info here: &gt; And for those asking, no formal pricing was announced for the solar roof.

But of course, to be a real game changer, the Chinese must pick up on the entire concept systematically, copy it, and make it way cheaper because of Chinese government subsidies until it causes trade wars between trading bloc and then we will see wide adoption worldwide.   I know this sucks for the US to have its innovation copied. But if you rely on Tesla alone to implement this system worldwide to reverse climate change, it wouldn't be enough.  We need the Chinese do what they did to solar panels with this tech: make it so cheap that the system is to be implemented all over the globe (at least for industrialised countries).

I'm a bot working hard to help Redditors find related videos to watch. *** [Play All]( | [Info]( | Get it on [Chrome]( / [Firefox]( This sucks!  I just had my house built brand new 5 years ago and the design is just like the italian home on the demo pics.  That roof would have been lovely.  And we have a 20kw generator that is powered by propane.  Hey, it was top at the time.  Now I feel a bit behind.... Since the solar roof is dependent on the merger I'm not expecting to  hear much in terms of pricing, availability, and specs for a while.  The Powerwall 2 has double the energy density of the Powerwall 1 and a built-in inverter.   I'm really curious about this inverter and if and Tesla will offer a stand alone unit. This is where the event was held. [34.139186, -118.345138]( I was really hoping they would show the energy production of the demo houses they had. It was a great presentation but a lot of details were left out. Anyone saved the webcast or have a link to kt? I was originally going to vote my Tesla shares against the merger, but now that I've seen what Elon Musk has planned for *his* SolarCity, I've changed my mind and will now vote my shares for the merger.  The solar roofs look straight-up amazing. Absolutely incredible. This is pretty amazing stuff. Anyone have a link that can direct me to costs? I'm actually in the market for a new roof and will definitely want to go this option. This is a pretty amazing opportunity. Say you have $140000 to spend on a car, it would be much better to buy 9 powerwalls (126 kWh with 63 kW delivery) for $50500, a maxed out options Model 3 at around $50000 and the rest to buy solar roof. For the price of a P100DL you could now instead opt for a slightly less performing car but with a 15-30 years worth of zero emissions energy for the car and the house paid in advance. I don\'t know about you but I\'d take that deal. I\'m not going to say anything against those that opt to buy the more expensive cars, I\'m just pointing out that if they don\'t partake on energy storage and generation, they\'re not really doing as much as they could to support the transition to sustainable energy production and transportation. Plus, don\'t you just hate when a vile, ignorant, repulsive person just says in an annoying voice ""Yeah, but your electric car pollutes more cause the electricity is produced by coal power plants"". Now anyone can do something about it and tell them to shut the fuck up. So the powerwall 2 is 14 KWhr of storage. If the model 3 is a 60 KWhr battery (and gets 200 miles of range) thats roughly 46 miles of range stored in the home. You're gonna need a couple of them if you want to power a home and still charge your car(s) overnight. At $5,500 per pack its still an expensive proposition. u/FredTesla please write an article on comparing the powerwall 2.0 to a generator, let's say a mikano 13kva. Whose houses were those? This is another tripple down strategy by Tesla. First focus on those with the spending capabilities in an early go to market face and through the years scale in a way that it is in reach for the middle class. I think this will succeed big time. Looks great!  I'm skeptical of tesla math on the cost. As someone who is currently in the framing stages of his new house this really gets me down as I won't be able to utilize the product.  I will be putting solar on the roof regardless, but this product looks great. The one thing I can't find anywhere is any pre-wire info for the old power wall or this new one. This new one seems to have everything including the inverter, so how does one preside for it - is there a min amount of solar required/max number (i.e. Is inverter size also 7kW, so put 7kW of solar on the roof?  Does Tye powerwall connect to the grid via a breaker in your panel?  I want to pre-wore my house to have the powerwall. Do what's the ultimate plan here? Solar roof to generate power, and the power wall stores extra and tries to supply your house when the solar roof isn't generating enough? There is zero information on the website. Some questions, in case anybody knows...  - rainwater harvesting is crucial for us (we have a metal roof for this), will these panels allow direct use of the water without treatment?  - will these shatter if a tree branch gets blown onto the roof?  - estimated power output per sq.metre?  - wiring?  - cost? Someone needs to discuss all of the practical details of this.  Obviously, I'm approaching this from the position of enthusiasm for such a product, but the literal roof is an area of a home that shouldn't be messed around with.  This needs to be incredibly reliable.  - Reliability is a huge concern (as is installation).  What are the installation details for a product like this?  Existing roof is stripped, then what?  Is some type of moisture barrier applied and then shingles installed? - How is this product serviced?  Is SolarCity responsible for the end-to-end of this?  Am I entirely at the mercy of SolarCity?  It doesn't seem like I would be able to ask a regular roofing company for any kind of servicing or installation.  I'm nervous about SolarCity being gone in 30 years and my solar roof being compromised. - What about everything else that's commonly found on a roof?  I have brick masonry chimneys.  Obviously, a mason will need the ability to walk around on the roof to do basic tuckpointing.  Can I trust regular contractors to walk around on my solar shingles? - What if my new solar roof leaks?   - Are the shingles slippery?  As a regular homeowner, can I get up on the roof to do basic things like clean leaves off?  I feel quite nervous about entrusting my entire house to an emerging piece of tech.  I'm concerned about reliability, leaking, maintenance, lock-in.  If SolarCity fucks up something, I can't call someone else, and the roof is critical.  At least with separate solar paneling I'm not risking the integrity of my house. I would like to know if they have had any full installation roofs (prototypes or final production level) sitting on a roof for a full year, in all climate types, so we can have a real-world sense of their performance, reliability and durability.  A roof protects your largest investment. If this new product is essentially just a ""Beta"" roof and is found to have issues, I doubt Tesla is likely to sweep into your home and fix any damage. So I want a bit of reassurance that they\'ve been real-world testing and tweaking this product and are sure it is at least as good as - if not better - than current roof systems. What did that guy in the beginning say to Elon that got everyone laughing? Can someone check if my math is correct?    &amp;nbsp;  Powerwall analysis for me (SCE Utility So Cal).   Peak kwh: .42   Non peak kwh: .11    &amp;nbsp;  No solar option (charge at night, use during day):   14 kwh x .31 cent savings x 365 days = 1584.1 annual savings   $6500 cost / 1584.1 =  4.1 year payback    &amp;nbsp;  Solar option (charge daytime, use at night):   14kwh x .11 kwh (non peak rate) x 365 days = 562.1   $6500 cost / 562.1 = 11.6 year payback Where is this neighborhood? Are these houses owned by the company?  edit: Found my my answer, [Universal Studios]( where they filmed desperate housewives Solar tiles have been out [for a while]( What's new about these? With the merger vote upcoming, Elon has every reason to release positive information on the solar/battery side of the business. That makes the absence of information worrying.   Things I want to know:  Pricing. What's the $/Watt and $/sq ft in material costs and in installation? The statement that it is competitive with other roofing gives tons of wiggle room - is it competitive with cheap asphalt roofing or top of the line roofing? Is that assuming 5 years at average solar prices, typical sunlight, or 30 years with no shadow on a south facing roof in southern California?  Inverter. Can it use the powerwall's inverter? Does Tesla make an inverter for it, or 3rd party?  Wiring. How do the tiles connect?  Installation. Who does it, how complicated is it?  Software. How does the powerwall choose when to charge and when to discharge in a grid tied system? How nicely does that integrate with solar hardware and software?  Until we have that information, most of all the price, it's really hard to say 1) how good this product is, and 2) whether it makes sense for Tesla to be doing it themselves. Assuming I don't need more than about 8 hours of backup, PW2 now seems competitive with a proper standby generator. I don't mean the noisy smelly little Honda, I mean the permanent box on a concrete pad thing.  The roof thing...TBD...I can't find any meaningful specs for it. Okay so here is the single biggest question  How does the system fix the biggest issue with being a string-inverter system? Namely, if any panels are in the shade it reduces the entire series to that level of power. This is why microinverters are normally better. But we know this is likely to be a string inverter because the inverter is built into the new powerwall.   I'm sure musk has some sort of fix. My best guess? Each column of cells (assuming they attach that way) can independently connect and disconnect from the system. The system real-time monitors each column and calculates the highest power output either through having the hit from the shade, or having all cells operate at a higher power with the shaded ones merely disconnected. Does anyone have any idea how the financing would work?  We will be building a new house, so would I have to contract separately for the roof and then have a separate payment for that? What was the little tiny Tesla? Is the new Powerwall really that much more economical? Didnt the original powerwall store 7KWh and cost 3k? now this is 14KWH for 5.5k. Thats just a $500 discount on 2 old units no? Am I missing something? Haven't had time to watch it-do we know when the tiles are coming out?",1687,"He's now 5 minutes late already :) Autonomous cars and rockets to Mars, but can't keep a stream running.

Will try to reach half speed of sound (and brake) within ~1.2km.""",81.0,166.0,"In 1865, [Jules Verne's vision of space travel]( involved a cannon barrel shooting a projectile skyward. I understand that achieving orbit requires horizontal velocity (tangent to the surface) and not just achieving vertical altitude (as do Virgin Galactic's spaceship Unity or Blue Origin's New Shepard).     So why not a gun barrel with a 45 degree slant pointed due east and a magnetic railgun accelerator? With a 1.2 km long tunnel and 5 g acceleration, it seems you could achieve 240 m/sec (0.7 Mach) at muzzle exit in the horizontal vector. Only minor incremental on-board mass ... no fuel, just structural connection to the accelerator ... required to gain this head start. Upon exiting the tunnel, the booster throttles up and already has a bit of orbital velocity at T-0.    I can imagine that putting a launcher 1 km underground would be a challenge.  But formerly ridiculous concepts like landing a 30 story tall booster now look easy.    Does low-cost tunneling bring this 150 year old idea any closer to economic reality? Hmm. This is actually really relevant for mars. Given that the orbital velocity at 400km is 3300m/s. Build a launchrail along mt olympus so it might be in theory possible to achieve orbit with no propellant on mars. (Havent done the math on drag at 25+km height mars atmosphere which would be end of rail after which youd be perhaps headed for orbit.) If they pull it off it'll match or (barely) beat the current world record for trains. Not bad for a first test. ehh, I don't really follow Hyperloop stuff, just trying to set my bearings, is it a Tesla thing, or a SpaceX thing or a Boring thing, is it on its own, or it is just a clear crystal cut as F9 versioning?

With the arrival of the block V (or 7) and the possible introduction of Blue Origin's New Glenn, it appears that this rocket has its work cut out for it.   This rocket uses solid fuel (so presumably no reusability), as well as reliance on older technology (Space Shuttle SRB's). Any thoughts on how this will turn out? Surprised at the fineness ratio. This rocket is both very tall and very thin. I'd bet it has very strict weather criteria. In addition, those solid will certainly make for a bumpy ride. It's a LEGO Ares I.

It\'ll probably be their last rocket design.  There\'s just no way this is cost efficient.  While the ""stack a bunch of solid sections against the hangar wall"" philosophy might work as an emergency/contingency launch provider in the days of non-reusability, it\'s a non-issue when you have a launch vendor capable of 2 week cadence like SpaceX, and has tackled first stage reusability and has a ready stockpile and rapid production line for second stages.  As we\'ve learned from Challenger, SRB segments MUST be sealed correctly and not launched outside of optimal weather constraints.  Perhaps Omega addresses these shortcomings, or perhaps it only documents them more forcefully for the customer to read.  Taking several SRB components and lego-ing them into a rocket is going to take several days or more, and I think an F9 can be mated to a 2nd stage and payload faster.  Or a New Glenn, for that matter.  I see this being something that dotmil will appreciate in a token manner, pay it the minimum to keep it as a viable launch alternative for a few years, but will ultimately be little more than a bizarre footnote in the evolution of rocketry. How does a fully SRB rocket control attitude without aerodynamic surfaces?   Is the nozzle movable, are there thrusters on the top stage, or can the side boosters swivel and is it hoping for a good trajectory until the third stage fires? Something else? The video has been up for a day with 2000 views. If SpaceX puts up a new video they'll have 200 000 views in a couple of hours.  The race for gaining attention is definitely already settled. Not reusable. Not usable. Not to be harsh but I can't think of a way this could be more disappointing they're still playing the old game, even though the game has changed.    at least they're ahead of arianespace",125,"Any rocket in the design stages that is not fully reusable is completely and utterly irrelevant and outdated.  That mathematics favoring full reusability is simply too powerful. Honest opinion: I've seen some photos with 6 side SRBs. If these are shuttle boosters, this will be the most powerful rocket ever, even more powerful then the BFR. I don't think they're shuttle boosters cause Max Q with 6 would rip anything apart. Looks like an evolution of the Antares rocket. With solid first and second stages. Boosters and first stage may be recoverable. I really dislike the idea of a solid second stage because that means you have to use the third stage for every mission. Third stage seems like it will be outsourced to ULA which is fine because orbital only really makes solid rocket engines. Carbon fibre for solid rocket engines? Really? It's one thing to hold something really cold and stays cold, it's totally something different to hold something that flash heats. Omega, Vulcan, Adeline etc. They're not sincere proposals. They're job is to deceive lesser share holders into believing their shares are worth keeping and maybe encourage them to buy more?  In my humble opinion.",11

You\'re probably right because it\'s the simplest solution but I was personally also hoping for some Neuralink related stuff. I\'ve seen a video once where they made a lizard (""Dragon"") body walk and swim by applying electric current to its spinal cord. All of its movements are saved in some kind of spinal memory. I learned that the spinal cord is much more than just a cable and it is therefore really complex and difficult to fix it.  Having some kind of A.I. that would make a paralized lizard walk and swim would make big big waves and give hope to people who are bound to a wheel chair!   Can\'t find the video I\'ve seen but it was similar to this just much longer and with a big lizard: [Video]( I think he's making another Burning Man art car I assumed it was related to the dragon comments from Kanye??",38,I assumed it was something relating to the Boring company flamethrowers.,0

Any idea when this would be?  End of May?  He also said the numbers are very big. Perhaps GF China announcement, along with a 3rd party buying a large stake in Tesla (providing billions in cash infusion) Electrek is talking about a 1 GWh battery.  In any case it will be fun. Tesla 2170 cell pack battery cost of under $100 per kWh? Tomorrow\'s Headline:  ""Tesla shorts lose their shorts!"" If you own shares of TSLA, go on your app and place a limit order for $1000 (or some large number) on your shares, GTC (good til cancelled). That means that if the shares reach $1000 (or whatever limit you want to set), the shares will automatically be sold.  Why? Because when you put such an order against your shares, they cannot legally be lent to short sellers, reducing the number of shares available to short and thus squeezing the short sellers just a bit more. Yes, those shares you hold at Schwab, eTrade or TD are probably being lent out right now to short sellers. Anyone know a good simple explanation video that explains short stocks and how they work? Im late to the party here but this has got to be model 3 production numbers after restarting the line.  If its significantly better than expected its probably 6k+ vehicles / week.  That number will do it.  The short squeeze of all time. Im long TSLA so a nice short burn monday morning would indeed make me chuckle. But either way, Im holding until TSLA is a trillion dollar company or Elon leaves. Ambien and red wine for Elon again? I failed to buy the last dip and am kicking myself. My first payment on my Model X was due, so I figured sit this round out. The short squeeze would come from Tesla being profitable. I don't remember Elon saying how important it was to be a real company by showing a sustained profit before.  Some possibilities:  1) Model 3 production is going great.  Positive gross margins ensue.  2) FSD features will be released and they can start recognizing revenue, maybe selling upgrades.  3) Multi GWh projects sold.  4) Solar Roof is ready? My guess is that it probably has to do with the China\'s GF announcement during the earning call.   So Tesla gets external cash injection to making it to not raise capital on the public market. Perhaps that\'s why Elon specifically says ""he doesn\'t want to raise more capital through equity."" He was pretty assertive and annoyed when multiple analysts asked him the question about raising capitals on the conference call. Right now, the market doesn\'t believe Tesla will get through without a capital raise this year. It doesn\'t believe a single word coming out of Elon\'s mouth unless a materially significant financial event happens.  People speculating on Buffet investing in the company, while not entirely impossible, the chances are close to 0. Heck, i think Amazon has a higher chance investing in Tesla than Berkshire does lol, even though it seems like Elon doesn\'t really get along with Bezos. The probability for either events to happen is just super low. If it does happen, the short squeeze will get real like Elon predicted.  I personally think he should just shut up on this matter. Spouting these stuffs on twitter over the last couple days just show me how much pain he is going through. Although Elon probably knew the public wouldn\'t believe him anyway, he pretty much almost always acts like this in the past when going through tremendous amount of stress. What does he mean by this? this is fucking hilarious shit. never seen something like this in my fucking life. all the short positions possible being bought up. and people wonder why there are so many puppets shitting on tesla. it's one of the most massively shorted stocks ever.  i cant believe so many people are betting against the guy that managed to run two of the most technologically cutting edge companies in the world. creating two different fields where no one thought was even feasible as a business.

It\'s super annoying that ""Boring"" is one letter away from ""Boeing"", and that those letters are adjacent on the keyboard. He's perfecting the technology so his mars colony will be ready for it. Since it'll probably have to be mostly under ground City Center huh?   Will it be built next to union station and link up with the rail lines? The Gold line? Metro Center?  Is any sort of integration with the over $120 billion of transit investment LA has lined up?  I really hope the answer is yes, otherwise Musk is disrupting the mobility improvements designed for millions of people for a vanity project that will serve a few thousand.   As a transit planner, I am not at all impressed with the planning choices the boring company has articulated thus far.   Edit: for anyone interested, I'd urge you to give [this critique of Musks's plans]( a read. It goes over the essentials more elegantly than I can. It's better to have discussions while on the same page. It seems beyond belief that the US government, or other governments would allow BFR to take off off or land over even thinly populated areas.  And there are few land areas within close range of most major cities that aren't heavily populated.  The US government won't even allow the most reliable rocket in history to launch over populated areas.  Rockets like ULA's Atlas V, which has never experienced a near-Earth failure, yet would be entirely unlikely to be permitted a launch over even thinly populated areas.  Part of that is clearly the risk of expended first stages falling over land, but not all.  An Atlas from Vandenberg could have its stage fall in the nearby test range.    SpaceX's life would be so much easier if rockets were permitted to take of eastward from Vandenberg, landing first stages on a land based target.  Yet SpaceX seems to never even attempted to seek approval for this far more efficient Eastern launch profile.  Restricting all landing and takeoff profiles to over water would be extremely limiting to the prospects of BFR Air, just as they were to Concorde.  This aside from the many regulatory hurdles facing BFR Air,  not the least of which is ITAR.  Perhaps that's why a tunnel 50 to 100 miles off shore is the plan.  A very expensive plan.  A plan that would add significant costs to every BFR ticket.  If anything, the reveal of this plan diminishes further the prospects that BFR Air will soon or ever launch paying customers.  Perhaps it sends up a few Krmn line tourists, but city-to-city travel presents almost insurmountable hurdles, at least within the first decade or two of BFR flights.  TLDR - It's difficult to see BFR Air surpassing the commercial, political, or [NIMBY]( hurdles.  Perhaps those concerns diminish after a decade or two of safe flight , but even then, it would be an expensive, and heavy lift. ###&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009;  Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, contractions, and other phrases which expand to something larger, that I\'ve seen in this thread:  |Fewer Letters|More Letters| |-------|---------|---| |[ASAP](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz4off7 ""Last usage"")|Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, NASA| | |Arianespace System for Auxiliary Payloads| |[BFR](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dzlu0x2 ""Last usage"")|Big Falcon Rocket (2018 rebiggened edition)| | |Yes, the F stands for something else; no, you\'re not the first to notice| |[BFS](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz5x9nj ""Last usage"")|Big Falcon Spaceship (see BFR)| |[BO](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz4jk4w ""Last usage"")|Blue Origin (*Bezos Rocketry*)| |[E2E](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz4n8ze ""Last usage"")|Earth-to-Earth (suborbital flight)| |ETOV|Earth To Orbit Vehicle (common parlance: ""rocket"")| |[FAA](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dzah4nq ""Last usage"")|Federal Aviation Administration| |[IAC](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz5o1hc ""Last usage"")|International Astronautical Congress, annual meeting of IAF members| | |In-Air Capture of space-flown hardware| |IAF|[International Astronautical Federation](| | |Indian Air Force| |[ICBM](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz4prp8 ""Last usage"")|Intercontinental Ballistic Missile| |[ITAR](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dzluiuw ""Last usage"")|(US) International Traffic in Arms Regulations| |ITS|Interplanetary Transport System (2016 oversized edition) (see MCT)| | |[Integrated Truss Structure](| |[LEO](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz69hnl ""Last usage"")|Low Earth Orbit (180-2000km)| | |Law Enforcement Officer (most often mentioned during transport operations)| |[LV](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz4cjnq ""Last usage"")|Launch Vehicle (common parlance: ""rocket""), see ETOV| |MCT|Mars Colonial Transporter (see ITS)| |[RCS](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz6emod ""Last usage"")|Reaction Control System| |[RUD](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz4wpyf ""Last usage"")|Rapid Unplanned Disassembly| | |Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly| | |Rapid Unintended Disassembly| |[ULA](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz4xs9g ""Last usage"")|United Launch Alliance (Lockheed/Boeing joint venture)|  |Jargon|Definition| |-------|---------|---| |[Raptor](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz6emod ""Last usage"")|[Methane-fueled rocket engine]( under development by SpaceX, see ITS| |[Sabatier](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz4gh2r ""Last usage"")|Reaction between hydrogen and carbon dioxide at high temperature and pressure, with nickel as catalyst, yielding methane and water| |[Starlink](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz4kfy5 ""Last usage"")|SpaceX\'s world-wide satellite broadband constellation| |[apogee](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz48rsh ""Last usage"")|Highest point in an elliptical orbit around Earth (when the orbiter is slowest)| |[electrolysis](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz4gh2r ""Last usage"")|Application of DC current to separate a solution into its constituents (for example, water to hydrogen and oxygen)| |[methalox](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz6ao0t ""Last usage"")|Portmanteau: methane/liquid oxygen mixture| |[perigee](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz48rsh ""Last usage"")|Lowest point in an elliptical orbit around the Earth (when the orbiter is fastest)| |[retropropulsion](/r/SpaceX/comments/8jzmj6//dz6bbmr ""Last usage"")|Thrust in the opposite direction to current motion, reducing speed|  ---------------- ^(*Decronym is a community product of r/SpaceX, implemented* )[*^by ^request*](   ^(22 acronyms in this thread; )[^the ^most ^compressed ^thread ^commented ^on ^today](/r/SpaceX/comments/8gi84y)^( has 158 acronyms.)   ^([Thread #4035 for this sub, first seen 17th May 2018, 03:32])  [^\\[FAQ\\]]( [^\\[Full ^list\\]]( [^\\[Contact\\]]( [^\\[Source ^code\\]]( Ill be there!

Edit:  I'm all for SpaceX, I just don't see   a) how the economics realistically work   b) the compelling Grand Vision that inspires the masses I love how all his companies can be put together and accomplish something even bigger.  I can see a future where an electric autonomous car will pic you up from your home in LA at the right time before departure, drive you to the closest boring elevator and continue underground to the bfr self check-in point and to the hyperloop shuttle station. This will ultimately bring you to the off-shore launchpad 300km away from the city center where a BFR is waiting for you. This will bring you to the Singapore landing pad where the same happens until you reach your second home there. Door to door estimated travel time: 4 hours. Man the livestream is at 4am european time. Still worth it tho. I have this mental image of the various teams at SpaceX, Boring company, and Hyperloop reading this tweet, and saying 'Oh, great. He's done it again. Guys, we need to change the requirements.' [Here is a t-shirt to celebrate]( Ok, here's a crazy wildcard. There are obviously issues operating BFR near populated areas. Out to sea rules out a lot of countries, particularly in Western Europe. So land it in a tunnel. If BFR depends on accurately landing on the launch clamps, it can just as well drop into a shaft at terminal velocity like a reverse ICBM. From 150m/s to 0 in 2km is just over half an additional G. And I am Danny devito Its insane reading a thread where people are discussing the possibilties of taking hyperloops to spaceports, I remember following the first falcon and people saying they would never be able to land it, man I love living in this century. Musk must be thinking he has to get far away from the land, otherwise I don't think you beat high speed ferries in costs and availability and simplicity.  Even today you can cruise at 50knots in one. Probably could build one that could do 70knots. Trimaran or hydrofoil.  Probably near a practical limit on high speed boats with speed and comfort and sea states and water resistance. Also boat traffic in congested ports areas. The integration potential between companies he owns/runs astounds me Why not take it to the next level while there at it, stay in your seat and it will load you into the rocket. So 10pm ElonStandardTime? over 2700 watching this boring show What I think will really tie together these services efficiently, with high amount of safety and comfort, will be directly integrating the hyperloop pod as the passenger transport module for the point-to-point transit.   You strap into your hyperloop pod at a terminus, it's a sealed pod with it's own life support (operates in a vacuum tube afterall) and seating to protect passengers through high acceleration and emergency braking. It's effectively a rocket capsule.  So why if you are already in a rocket capsule, would you hop out of one, walk across a bridge to some big rocket, sit down in another chair and strap in? Then do it again on landing to transfer to another pod?  Loading aircraft with people on foot takes a long time, 30 minutes easily. With point-to-point rocket transit the time to load and unload the passengers on foot will be longer than the flight.   Now if instead your passenger loading just involves a large robotic arm gently slotting hyperloop pods into a giant wine rack in the BFR cargo bay, then loading/unloading could be done in like 10 minutes. Slot the pods into the rack (aligned so the crash couches of the pods are aligned for launch/landing. Close the doors and go.   When you land, the pods can be unloaded and placed straight into a hyperloop tube at the service tower, whisked away off towards the city. People could be hopping out of the first pod in the city before the last pod is even unloaded.   Passenger management is a huge engineering problem for airlines. Loading and Unloading passengers, and managing passengers in airports with traffic flows and security is a major cost in air travel. If you eliminate foot traffic passengers entirely on the launch site, integrate the airport mass transit with regional mass transit, and have all the security handled at the hyperloop terminals, then you have basically eliminated 90% of the cost issues of airports.    What's more this logistics system could easily include cargo. A cargo hyperloop pod could be loaded in one city, whisked to launch port, loaded and it's being unloaded in another city in under an hour.   There is already a huge market for international flights of high value perishable goods, imagine if someone catches a big Tuna off the coast of New Zealand. A bidding war online occurs as soon as it's landed on the boat. Boat returns to port and the fish is loaded on pod. Within an hour, that fish is being unloaded from a pod in downtown Tokyo's elite restaurant district. This aged like warm milk",750,You make some great points and I only want to make a rather obvious correction I think it wouldn't be BFR Air but rather BFAIR.  Rolls of the tongue so much better.,0

You would be prompted by the Tesla app to move your phone to the passenger side and driver side, rear and front to attempt to triangulate the location and identify the issue.   I don't see how it would do much better than the human ear, but someone within Tesla must have figured out how to make it work well or Elon wouldn't have mentioned it. this is amazing news. theres wind noise coming from the drivers side window that occurs even when the window is closed, so this is big help Holy shit this would be the best feature. Maybe I should trade in my car Shazam but for rattle. Id prefer more useful stuff like:  1) Voice activated sunroof via the voice button.   2) Voice activated unlock when Im in the car and tap the right voice button so I dont have to use my hands to unlock the car if Im picking someone up.   3) Ability to watch videos on the center monitor if Im supercharging. Via YouTube or broadcasted from my phone. Whatever. It would be a ridiculously badass feature for supercharging.   4) Optional app data to show paths the vehicle has traveled in the phone app.   5) Better built gears for Model S / X door handles to prevent future issues.   6) A sunroof that doesnt whistle like a banshee when its opening and closing while Im driving.   7) Let me see the forward facing car camera from my phone for security purposes.   8) Optional automatic phone access for Model S and X owners?  The car stereo easily picks up my Bluetooth calls when I open the door so range isnt an issue, just authenticate via the mobile app for extra security.   9) Show video feeds from side marker cameras when in reverse. BOOM! No more curbed wheels for cars with AP.  10) When I slow down or when my destination is close, the nav screen should automatically zoom in to the area Im in.  I dont need to see the whole city when Im .5 miles away from my location and I could really use nearby street names.  Yes, the dash screen displays this but the center screen should zoom in. To triangulate though doesn't the source have to be within the 3 points you are using to find it. So if you use the mic in a phone, 1 in the car, where is the next and will it be able to see behind the dash? I don't see how this will ever work. The only time we hear something is while driving. Trying to pinpoint a rattle and squeek with road noise by ear is already hard enough. Do phones even have a mic that is sensitive enough to even attemt this? If only their own factory workers could do this. Taking my less than month on model 3 back to the shop for extremely loud creeping while driving under 5mph. This is the second time in 2 weeks This actually would work really well when you designate some ""test highway"" segments. If 1000 different model 3s all travel down the exact same section of highway 95, in the exact same lane, at precisely 70 mph it should be very easy to find something out of the norm. Find some areas that are recently paved with fresh asphalt \\(since concrete makes such a different and louder noise\\) and anything that\'s wrong should create a detectable cyclical noise. I wish theyd license this to other apps. I need this everywhere in my life. So many noises I cant find or explain :-( I have this already, its called my wife.  She will hunt that noise down until eliminated. Wouldn't it be cheaper and easier to build a car that doesn't squeak or rattle? Still no AA or Apple Carplay but ok. Isn't that the service department's responsibility? Why should an owner have to locate the squeak when the service department is in charge of fixing it? Not high on my list of value add upgrades I wonder if this is actually driven by service to locate noises and Elon is sharing it with us. Might as well if service is working on the app for their own use. Good luck with that. Work on getting a usable voice command system/bug report system first. This would be great, because I'm having a hard time getting Tesla to replace my rattling seat belt adjuster because they can't replicate the problem (it is dependent on speed/road surface). What other mass adoption car maker does this? As someone looking to buy a product this does not make me feel like said product has all the bugs worked out yet. How about just letting owners know. So stupid.  Id rather see a Spotify or Pandora integration.

Who hasn't taken their hands off the wheel just for a few seconds while lane assist keeps you in check?  Instead of banning people who abuse it, instead make the threshold for disengaging the autopilot lower. I agree that people abuse the system, and they clearly shouldnt. That said, I am guilty of not having my hands on the wheel the whole time if I am stretching or moving in my seat  I assume under your idea you would need to refund everyones money who gets banned? That would be a big cash drain on tesla.  Also, if I purchase a product, it is my product, I can do with it what I like. Saying that something I own can be taken away from me because someone doesnt agree with how I am using it does not work. The manufacturer can limit their liability based on how I used the product, but they cant take it away once I own it (otherwise I dont really own it..) You didnt mention your personal experience with Auto Pilot.  Which have you driven and what was your experience like? Maybe we should ban cellphone also if they use it while driving.    It may hurt Apple or Samsungs reputation.   We need to make AP or any other driver assistance better and safer. Not worry about companys reputation. We aren't talking about some free service that's being provided by society or something. People paid for autopilot.  The fix is not banning people from using something they paid for, and actually making autopilot foolproof. We don't get to tell people they can and cannot use a feature they paid for.  I work in software. When the software can be used in a way that is not intended, we don't blame the customer. We fix it. People are killing each other to the tune of 3,000 crash deaths per day but you're concerned with the small number of people misusing Autopilot? Removing the human element from driving as fast as possible needs to happen and Autopilot is making strides toward that goal. What they're doing is wrong and you can lock people out of using Autopilot because they aren't keeping their hands on the wheel, but that doesn't make that person any better of a driver without Autopilot. A bad driver is a bad driver, with or without Tesla's fancy cruise control. If we all had to follow the official rules there would be no point in using it at all.  Tesla wants people to use AP as much as possible so they can get data/get the kinks out.  They could disable it on side roads (like GM does with it's Super Cruise) but they don't. They could make a system that requires hands constantly on the wheel but they don't.    During my test drive the sales rep specifically sold me that now I could drop my cell phone and go get it or turn around to correct my kids in the back seat. The main part of the problem is the way Autopilot is sold.  It is quite disturbing and very misleading - especially during End of Quarter pushes.  Tesla needs to correct this.  During Test Drives Owner Advisors &amp; CES take the same repeated routes where they know the functionality of Autopilot to a T.  Once the user experiences the functionality they are upsold on the fact that the Autopilot can operate pretty much like that on any major road/highway - excluding back roads.  This is quite deceptive to the consumer. This problem will solve itself. The drivers will acclimate to working with an automated assistant like airline pilots have, and the automated assistant (autopilot) will get better and better so that it can be trusted more. When those two lines converge, it's no longer a problem. I'd assume musk can't take the feature away without a $5k refund?

It sucks how many people will die as a result of the lockdown orders while the most ignorant and unscientific morons berate people for wanting to keep their jobs as morons.   Its worse than dumb. Its fucking cruel. People still promoting lockdown orders after the data have mostly shown they do nothing to reduce the virus which is not that dangerous anyway are losers.

Try to give Elon a chance to redeeme and/or explain himself. The lockdowns were necessary and beneficial up to a certain point but the most recent science, new data and history all indicate our initial understanding of CV19 was incomplete. When you say:  &gt;we should be more strict on lockdowns as we get closer to herd immunity  This indicates you\'re not understanding the science because locking down everyone directly *prevents* progress toward herd immunity. A new paper out yesterday shows that positive effects of herd immunity may start as low as 20% and reach full effect well before 50%.  We shouldn\'t end the lockdowns just because they disproportionately target the most vulnerable: [our poor,]( [disadvantaged]( and marginalized, we should do it because deaths are *still* going up and analysis of the data shows [lockdowns are no longer working well.](  Important new serology studies have come out in the past week from [Finland,]( [Denmark,]( [New York,]( [China,]( Italy, [Boston,]( [Santa Clara,]( [Germany,]( [Netherlands,]( Angeles,]( [Miami,]( [Denmark #2,]( and [Switzerland](  They are all directionally in agreement that CV19 is far more widespread than thought, making it much less deadly than once feared because there are a large number of previously undetected asymptomatic and mild cases missing from the denominator. These new serology results are consistent with other recent non-serology findings, including whole-population RT-PCR tests in prisons, shelters and navy ships, showing that CV19\'s contagiousness is very high (R0=[5.2]( to [6.6]( that [50%]( to [80%]( of infections are asymptomatic, that completely asymptomaticand [pre-symptomatic]( people do infect others and that the global fatality rate is much lower than previously thought (IFR=[0.12%]( to [0.36%]( The Denmark study showed the under-70 IFR is [0.08%]( and the Italy under-60 IFR is [at 0.05%.]( The newly revised Santa Clara/Stanford study shows all-age IFR is [0.17%](  Unlike the first estimate of a 3.4% fatality rate back in February, we no longer need to rely on early partial data from a single city. We now have many different experiments done by different teams of scientists, using different populations around the world and different methodologies. While science is not done by consensus, the results of the over 40 separate studies we have as of yesterday, indicate a median IFR of 0.2%. I don\'t think we can call this definitive yet but it does significantly narrow the possible range of IFR toward the lower end. Two months ago we feared the fatality rate was 3.4%. Even four weeks ago there were a lot of people who still feared IFR might be as much as 1%. Today, we can be increasingly confident that IFR is almost certainly under 0.5% (an upper-bound set by NY, one of the hardest hit), and likely between \\~0.1% and \\~0.3% with the vast majority of fatalities focused on 70+ year-olds already in failing health, which is where we should focus all our efforts and resources instead of massive [lockdowns of everyone.](  These scientific breakthroughs also show that CV19 is not nearly as deadly as we thought. Tens of millions of people have already been infected, never even felt sick and are now immune, probably for three to five years.These discoveries led [Tom Jefferson, an epidemiologist]( with the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford to say  &gt;There can be little doubt that covid-19 may be far more widely distributed than some may believe... and is unlikely at this point to slow or halt viral circulation as the genie is out of the bottle.  Scientists around the world have succeeded in bringing us the knowledge needed to save more lives and beat CV19 faster. Recent antibody tests show that 25% of NYC is already infected. The unprecedented worldwide lockdown was a heroic effort but has barely slowed our enemy\'s advance. It\'s time to change tactics from trying to hide from CV19 and instead commit to directly shielding the elderly and at-risk from death as [Sweden is successfully doing ]( this [new study supports.](  The only questions that remain are whether the public will have the wisdom to understand that the science has changed and if our leaders will find the courage to act on it.  We need to ask ourselves, what is the purpose of continuing lockdowns now? They already did their job by preventing hospitals being overwhelmed. In fact, except in NYC for a few days, nowhere in the U.S. even got close. Now that the surge has passed, there is no further benefit in continuing lockdowns. Remember, lockdowns don\'t ""save"" anyone. They\'re merely a temporary ""Pause"" button. Delaying isn\'t ""saving"" anyone, it\'s just building a bigger backlog of postponed infections while slowing our progress toward the immunity that *will*save lives.  &amp;#x200B;  1/2",8

The complaint, Vaughn v. Tesla Inc. in the Superior Court of California, alleges that Tesla workers, including supervisors, regularly used derogatory and discriminatory language against black workers.  &gt;Although Tesla stands out as a groundbreaking company at the forefront of the electric car revolution, its standard operating procedure at the Tesla factory is pre-Civil Rights era race discrimination, the employee said in the complaint, filed Monday in Californias Alameda County Superior Court.   &gt;[...]  &gt;The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Marcus Vaughn, who worked in the Fremont factory from April 23 to Oct. 31. Vaughn alleged that employees and supervisors regularly used the N word around him and other black colleagues. Vaughn said he complained in writing to human resources and Musk and was terminated in late October for not having a positive attitude.  &gt;\tVaughn also claimed that Teslas workplace was a hotbed for racist behavior, and follows another lawsuit alleging racially-driven harassment and discrimination filed against the automaker last month.  &gt;Vaughns complaint also allegedly quotes a letter from CEO Elon Musk, via Bloomberg:  &gt;According to Mondays complaint, Musk sent an email to Tesla factory employees on May 31.  &gt;Part of not being a huge jerk is considering how someone might feel who is part of [a] historically less represented group, Musk wrote in the email. Sometimes these things happen unintentionally, in which case you should apologize. In fairness, if someone is a jerk to you, but sincerely apologizes, it is important to be thick-skinned and accept that apology.  &gt;The law doesnt require you to have a thick skin, Organ said in an interview Monday. Tesla is not doing enough. Its somewhat akin to saying stop being politically correct. When you have a diverse workforce, you need to take steps to make sure everyone feels welcome in that workforce.\ufeff  &gt;\tIm not sure how somebody could unintentionally use the N-word against a fellow employee, and the sheer amount of accusations against the company could suggest something more than a policy of apologies and thick skin is needed.  &gt;Other recent lawsuits filed against Tesla include claims that the company failed to give proper notice when laying off hundreds of workers, claims concerning anti-LGTBQ harassment, a complaint from a woman engineer alleging harassment, and a complaint from the National Labor Relations Board defending employee claims that Tesla attempted to suppress a unionization effort. Elon benefited from his familys apartheid money which was obtained through slave labor, so its really no surprise that this is how his black workers are treated. But don\'t you remember what he said about the Black Lives Matter protests? ""I will be on that line with everyone else.

Never bet against Elon. My guess is orbit in the beginning of 2022, but I hope I'm wrong Eric Berger (ArsTechnica) who interviewed Musk and is a fan of SpaceX believes the chances for this year in orbit are 1%.  Zubrin also doesn't believe in this year.   It would be quite insane. Elon isn't even sure where the first launch will be (even considers a water platform).  My guess is middle of 2021 if there isn't some big road block (significant design problem etc.) If they figure it out the test &amp; pad procedures they easily make a sub orbital flight last quarter of this year. And an orbital flight at the first half of the 2021.  &amp;#x200B;  They lost last 2 starship because of the pad and test errors. Six months, give or take a couple of months.  For orbit they need Super Heavy, which they haven't yet started constructing. However, Musk just tweeted that there will soon a taller VAB to assemble it in, so construction could start fairly soon. Super Heavy has a lot in common with Starship, and they need to get those common elements figured out first - mainly the pressure vessels. They are getting close to that. I believe that once Starship is up to making hops, Super Heavy will proceed apace. Apart from the thrust dome and more engines, there's not much extra to it. Raptor production has been slow, but that's partly because there's been no urgent demand for them. Musk has expressed confidence they can ramp up to making a Raptor a day soon.   So it's not implausible that once work starts, Super Heavy will take 3-6 months. Meanwhile Starship will continue with higher hops, and start practising the landing. This continues at the fast pace we have seen, with a new test article every few weeks. So when Super Heavy is ready, Starship can be ready too.  They have a big incentive to get the point where they can make orbit reliably, because then they can use it to launch Starlink. If each launch deploys 180 satellites, that does the job of three Falcon 9 launches, which saves roughly $80M in money and 6 weeks in time. Also note they've been given $135M from NASA for Starship research, which will likely cover the bills for this period. So they have both the resources and the incentive to go fast on this.   As ever, remember that the factory is the main thing here. The rockets we see are by-products of testing the rocket factory. SpaceX will have a production line churning out cheap rockets quickly, and that will allow them to iterate quickly at each stage of development. They need to master the belly flop first. I'd say next year to orbit. I'm expecting a timeline like this, with lots of failures:  **Jul 2020:**  SN5 Hops (no wings) multiple times at 150 -1000m  testing legs &amp; basic low speed landing maneuvering  **Aug 2020**: SN6 with wings hops to 20,000 metres, attempts rotation into and out of skydiver descent, loses control, crashes.  **Sep 2020:** SN7 hops to 20,000 metres also loses control in transition and breaks up in flight.  **Nov 2020:**  SN8 makes successful landing after 20,000 metre flight, rotation into skydive, rotation out.  **Dec 2020:** Starship Test article with 6 engines successfully static fired on an elevated SS Launch stand  **Dec 2020:** First signs of Super Heavy test unit under construction  **Jan 2021:**  SN9, first with heat shield and 6 engines, crashes on landing.  **Feb 2021:**  Super Heavy test unit with 6 engines on a new, very elevated SH test stand with flame diverter at Boca Chica. Explodes during static fire due to thrust structure weakness  **Mar 2021:**  SN10 makes ballistic suborbital flight beyond Karman line  **Apr 2021:**  SN10 makes ballistic suborbital flight to 200 km and accelerates for reentry. Damaged by reentry heat but lands.  **May 2021:** Second Super Heavy Test unit achieves successful static fire of 6 engines  **Jun 2021:** SN11 makes several successful ballistic suborbital flights of increasing speed and complexity.  **Jun 2021:** First Super Heavy flight prototype (SH1) with 6 engines makes successful hop,  from a new (even larger) elevated Launch stand, but is damaged on landing.  **Jul 2021:** Second SH test article attempts static fire with 20 engines, explodes massively destroying the SH test stand (but not the Launch stand) and damages part of the Tank Farm. Fire burns out of control for 2 days.  **Aug 2021**: Rebuilding parts of tank farm and moving test stands into more distant locations, earth berms added  **Sep 2021:** SN12 , first Starship with apparent cargo hatches makes successful suborbital flight, tests hatch opening, deploys dummy payload.  **Oct 2021:** Third SH test article survives 20 engine static fire on replacement SH test stand  **Nov 2021:** SH2 (20 engines) with nose cone makes first suborbital flight, tests F9 style reentry/landing profile.  **Dec 2021:** SH3 (20 engines) &amp; SN12 launch from Boca Chica elevated SH launch stand, first orbital mission attempt, SH explodes at max q, destroying SN12 as well  **Jan 2022:** SH4 extensively tested with full duration burns of 20 raptors and dummy loading.  **Feb 2022:** SH5 &amp; SN14 complete successful orbital mission and landings     EDIT: Reduced the engine count for Super Heavy since 31 is not gonna be needed at first 6 month Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, contractions, and other phrases which expand to something larger, that I\'ve seen in this thread:  |Fewer Letters|More Letters| |-------|---------|---| |DMLS|[Selective Laser Melting]( additive manufacture, also Direct Metal Laser Sintering| |[EDL](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gyic9u/stub/ftem67e ""Last usage"")|Entry/Descent/Landing| |[GSE](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gyic9u/stub/ftb9uw9 ""Last usage"")|Ground Support Equipment| |[HLS](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gyic9u/stub/ftchlfm ""Last usage"")|Human Landing System (Artemis)| |[OCISLY](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gyic9u/stub/ftb5j6c ""Last usage"")|Of Course I Still Love You, Atlantic landing ~~barge~~ ship| |[RUD](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gyic9u/stub/ftb9uw9 ""Last usage"")|Rapid Unplanned Disassembly| | |Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly| | |Rapid Unintended Disassembly| |[SLS](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gyic9u/stub/ftbhn6s ""Last usage"")|Space Launch System heavy-lift| | |Selective Laser Sintering, contrast DMLS| |[SN](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gyic9u/stub/ftaqdp4 ""Last usage"")|(Raptor/Starship) Serial Number| |[SSTO](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gyic9u/stub/ftbamct ""Last usage"")|Single Stage to Orbit| | |Supersynchronous Transfer Orbit| |[VAB](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gyic9u/stub/ftatwqe ""Last usage"")|Vehicle Assembly Building|  |Jargon|Definition| |-------|---------|---| |[Raptor](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gyic9u/stub/ftcy04m ""Last usage"")|[Methane-fueled rocket engine]( under development by SpaceX| |[Starlink](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gyic9u/stub/ftem67e ""Last usage"")|SpaceX\'s world-wide satellite broadband constellation|  ---------------- ^(*Decronym is a community product of r/SpaceX, implemented* )[*^by ^request*](   ^(11 acronyms in this thread; )[^(the most compressed thread commented on today)](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/gv18n3)^( has 29 acronyms.)   ^([Thread #5486 for this sub, first seen 7th Jun 2020, 22:56])  ^[[FAQ]]( [^([Full list])]( [^[Contact]]( [^([Source code])]( I think first successful orbital attempt will happen around mid to late 2021.

SLS has been sitting on it's test stand for months in part because they can't afford to blow up half a billion dollars in engines. Now I don't know just how much checking and double checking you can do but I suspect that Elon will be darn sure that nothing can go wrong when strapping 20 (let alone 31) raptors to SH. Progress may get a little slower when we get to that point. I saved this post, and time will tell :)  RemindMe! 165 days Even if Starship flies orbital by 2025, itll be a total game changer.  My bet is on 2021 though.  I also think theyre going to mess up the 20kM hop a lot, which will delay the timeline a bit. Musk predictions + 2-3 years",90,"2025. It comes down to if they can SSTO an empty starship. If they need super heavy i doubt it will be until this time next year 2022 would make sense. You can build all the Starships you want, but without super heavy we go nowhere. Considering the test anomalies we're had with SNs, we should expect as mush with SH.",9

I really don't see point to point starship really being a thing. Not from a flight/technical standpoint but from issues such as pollution and noise, location of landing sites (in Europe your going to have to travel almost as long as the flight to get to a city). How do you control existing air traffic with starship coming in at supersonic speeds? And a variety of similar issues.  It's a nice idea but I just don't see it happening  Edited for mong spelling Air force one is designed for long term loitering and  command/control. Unless it was orbital, it would not provide for that. It would certainly make an impression the president stepping off a steaming Starship. Could happen too if there's a serious threat from the ground like air ambush with man portable launchers. Lot easier to secure a floating landing pad off the coast than a land-locked landing strip. That closest analogs I can think of to Moon/Mars bases are Antarctic bases and the ISS. Do presidents go to these? No, because they are sparsely populated research outposts.  Presidents go where there are sizable populations to connect with, where there are potential diplomatic and trade relations to establish, where there are social, political and economic issues/achievements or disasters they wish to see and understand for themselves.  I think we could establish lunar/Mars bases within 30 years, but I think we would spend the next several centuries converting them into actual cities with private residents, and only if we chose to. There hasn't been any push for this in Antarctica, on the sea floor, or in LEO, and Moon/Mars are inherently more expensive. How would it happen at the drastically more difficult and expensive place first? 2040s or 2050s Not until it has safety rating, and flight record equal or greater than airplanes. Even then I dont see any reason to risk the life of a world leader for a PR stunt.  Its also the presidents job to you know, take care of things on Earth, its not like they can just leave for a couple months to go visit Mars. People complain about golf trips, let alone space travel. Although a few people would probably like to see our current president sent on a one way trip to Mars.  Best case, maybe decades. Not really the answer you're looking for but Space Force One will be the designation for any aircraft operated by the Space Force with the president onboard which will likely happen looong before a spacecraft. AF1 has a cost in the ballpark of $4 billion.   A new 747 costs less than $400 million.  Which makes me wonder what a space craft purpose designed for presidential transport would cost.  I realize having a president just take a seat on a Dragon-2 would technically make it Space Force One, but I'm referring to building an Air Force One space analog. The feature requirements would be insane, but I bet getting the safety margins required would be the most expensive part.",27,,0

For all the naysayers saying ""but the grid is powered by coal/oil/whatever"", the marginal increase in emissions from charging an EV with ""dirty power"" is still going to be less than having an ICE on the road.  For all the naysayers saying ""but compact cars today get 40 mpg"", no 40 mpg car is ever going to get 40 mpg in the traffic jams of cities like NYC, Shanghai, London, etc. If your ICE car spends more time sitting still than moving during your commute, you\'re going to see maybe half its EPA rating. Not so bad with hybrids, but still bad since the engine will turn on at some point without you moving (I saw a 20% increase when I was trapped in a 2 hour jam driving a Fusion Hybrid). I've seen a number of these analyses that account for the more 'hidden' emissions on the electric side, but do they also account for extra emissions from oil extraction, refining, and transportation on the ICE side, before it even reaches the pump? (I know it's already lopsided enough.) [Breaks down by math]( Someone did the math and found that it was equivalent to the lifetime emissions of a petrol car if there was one that could get 88MPG.    It was determined that if everyone switched to an electric car, it could cut harmful emissions by 75%. The biggest flaw I see in the whole ""long tailpipe"" argument isn\'t just that it cherry picks the data and ignores the long chain of inefficiencies to get gas into your tank, it\'s that it fails to recognize that a long tailpipe itself would be awesome.  Step outside in any urban or suburban environment and you can smell vehicle exhaust.  You don\'t need any more sophisticated equipment than your nose to tell you that\'s probably not great for human health, but we\'ve all become numb to it after living with it our whole lives.

I would assume that the fading part is ""CO2 emissions from use"", based on context, but then the solid part would presumably be ""Co2 emissions from manufacture""... which doesn\'t make sense because the Model 3 gets different sized solid blue chunks in each graph.   EDIT: /brainfart. I totally missed that the units of this graph are CO2 emissions *per mile*. That\'s explains why the solid chunks (emissions from manufacturing) can change from car to car: Elon\'s saying the ridesharing ones will be driven a lot more miles before being replaced. i\'m still pretty skeptical about the size of those solid chunks, though. A non-ridesharing Model 3 should be a LOT more than an ICE. Not ~60% more, but rather 400+% more.  Also, I\'m pretty sure the CO2 emissions for manufacturing the battery is a LOT higher than the CO2 emissions from manufacturing an ICE. Like several times as high. It takes a few *years* for a Model 3 to break even with a Prius, even in a 100% renewable grid (as seen [here]( If only they were also cheaper I was sold on EV when someone pointed out they are ""fuel agnostic"".

No shit I\'m building an app, that helps people visualize the difference in renewable penetration during periods when their cars charge.  For example, my S70D charges around 2-5AM, only when strong renewables are present on the Texas grid.  This results in a 100 gCO2e/mi for daily use, a bit better than the ""Model 3 Personal Use"" in Elon\'s chart.  If I routinely just plugged in, and had my car charge around dinner, my CO2 emissions would be 50% higher, or at around 150 gCO2e/mi.    There is a convenience cost to doing this -- in that the car doesn\'t always show 90% SoC each morning, but rather, varies between about 45-80% most mornings.  I\'m building this because most of my personal reforms (changed habits) get a very tiny change in my overall CO2 footprint.  By adjusting my charging habits, I feel I get more green gains for my pains.  Plus, by grabbing energy when, e.g. Wind Turbines predominate, I help the price-discovery mechanism increase -- further incentivizing the build-out of wind energy. Haha no shit. Keep in mind also that the bulk of the life cycle emissions during manufacture and disposal are caused by fossil-fueled mining and fossil-fueled factories.   Well, both mining and manufacturing will be electrified AND get more and more of that electricity from solar and wind in the future. That means the emissions for all cars will go down dramatically over time because we will be making them and disposing of them with clean rather than dirty energy. Do we have sources for the graphs?

In this case, SpaceX has proposed to reuse future Falcon 9 and/or Crew Dragon systems or components for NASA missions to the International Space Station because they believe it will be beneficial from a safety and/or cost standpoint, she said.

My price didnt go up after delivery. That $3k coulda bought a lot of stock in August of 2018. Lose some win some. *Checks bank account* Still says $4,000 for me. Still too high for me dawgggg Now that FSD is different they should reintroduce Enhanced AP as an incremental upgrade path.  $2-3k for AP, plus $3k for EAP, plus $3-4k for FSD. I'm pretty glad I threw cash into TSLA stocks when EAP-&gt;FSD was at 2k. Still tempted to pass. I'm pretty happy with my car as-is, and figure when FSD really happens they'll have a subscription service or my car will be near EOL. Damn, just bought it 4 days ago at $4k because I thought the price was going *up* :(. Anyone dealt with a similar situation before? Will Tesla issue a credit? Purely based on how NoA behaves with my HW2.5/EAP, hard pass. Now just reduce the price of FSD to 5k from basic AP and I'll buy it. Well damn. This is exactly what I wanted to happen, but now that it happened Im upset because now Im considering spending the money lol. I had made up my mind I wouldnt spend 4k or 5k on it. Now I have to reconsider  uhhhhhh What does FSD get you that EAP doesnt? I asked my wife.  She denied my request. Eh not worth it. I'd do it for 2k though WHOA, that's huge! I was not expecting them to do *that* again.  Tesla must really want to make the books look good come the end of the quarter. Which is hardly surprising, since they lost like 2 months of production time. And don't they also hit a full year of consecutive profitable quarters if they make a profit in Q2 2020? That's really important. FSD price reduction and free supercharger miles if you get delivery of a new car before end of month...  seems like Tesla is pulling all strings to try to show a profit this month. They need an option on the Cybertruck pre-order for this Literally just purchased this for $4k this morning. I doubt Tesla will auto-refund and theres no way to cancel! Anyone whos successfully canceled - appreciate any pointers. I just need it to be a lifetime thing. I'm planning on leasing Teslas but won't/can't keep paying 7k+ for it to drive itself every 3 years My car has FSD, my wife's has basic AP.  When I drive her car the only feature I miss is changing lanes using the turn signal while on AP. Not even the automatic lane changes. I'd pay for just that feature, but the rest of FSD isn't worth it on a second car for me. How about making it free till it works and then charging people if they want to keep it. How about a paid trial version?   When I got the trial AP in early '19 it wasn't ready.   I'm not ready to spend that kind of money if I can't test it first on my daily trips. Sweet, sweet end of quarter cash. Difficult for me to justify this purchase even at a 'lower' cost. I am still waiting for NOA on divided highways to work properly. NOA works OK, but there is definitely room for improvement:  \\-Phantom braking  \\-Accelerating into exit ramp  \\-Fails to take some interchanges  \\-Get out of the passing lane  Would love to see them tighten up some of these loose ends. While I would like to get the 3.0 HW, I'm going to continue to stick with EAP.  By the time FSD features make me drool, I think I'll be ready for a new Tesla. What are peoples experiences getting the hardware upgrades for this? I have a sept 2018 model 3 Have they ever dropped the price of the long range awd speed update that's normally 2k? I would buy it at 1k, not really going for it at 2k. I paid almost 1 year ago and still waiting HW3.0 upgrade. Unless you have 3.0 hardware, you wont see the impact for a long time. Wasn't worth it when it was $2k to upgrade from EAP to FSD, definitely not worth it at 3k+ (for me) If I could move FSD when I switch cars, I would buy it. The price change is live as of 2:30pm Pacific time.  $3,000 for EAP --&gt; FSD. &lt;Insert why would anyone fall for last of qtr vaporware purchase comment&gt; /u/greentheonly thoughts on this:    Also this is extremely interesting:    I had suspicions on this when people with hw2.5 to 3 upgrades have reported that AP performance got back to how it was for them in 2019 with hw2.5 Let me have AP for life, then I may consider. If the car dies so does my AP license. I just got the email saying my VIN is eligible and offering it for $3K.... but if I already have EAP what am I getting TODAY (I know the future vision)? Is it anything? Or just future proofing.    And hell if I do bite, Ill get the MCU upgrade too, so itll be another few grand for that. Damn sales are never cheap :) I just received an email advertising the $3k price.   I'm on the fence. EAP is awesome and I can't imagine my commute without it. (When I had one, that is, pre-covid.) $2k I would have jumped on. $4k was a no. $3k has me thinking... I am way late to the discussion because I just got the email - but I do not see how this is a good purchase.  EAP gets nearly all the value of FSD today and this seems like a $3k gift to Tesla for a promise in return.    I honestly feel most bad for people who purchased FSD prior to today - i'm not sure what they have gotten over the past two years of ownership that I did not receive as an EAP owner.   At some point in the future, FSD is going to be worth $3k, or even significantly more than $3k.  But like those who purchased FSD in the past, how long should I be planning to wait for Full Self Driving to actually do any Self Driving in a meaningful way?  On performance: I love my Tesla, but my wife even hates the current auto-steering and on highway AP.  Hate it: Moving to the right at the end of an on-ramp to stay centered, phantom breaking, jerking 'out' of AP when it does something weird, choosing not to change lanes, or cancelling a lane change for bad reasons, bouncing in the lane.  we just went on a 2 hr drive and she openly questioned why i use autosteer 'since its so bad'.  On the value of purchase: i've already given Tesla $55k for a car they now sell for $46k.  I've already given Tesla $5k for a thing with 'value' of $7k.  If I gave Tesla $3k at original purchase, $2k during the sale or $4k last week, I don't see what I would have received.  So, I will choose not to give them $3k today because I do not see a short-term roadmap of Tesla delivering that much value and paying thousands of dollars for 'the mission' is a donation, not a purchase.",303,"I just ordered a model 3 with FSD for $7,000. I have not taken delivery yet- can I get this price too?  Sorry if its a dumb question. Im new to the world of Tesla! pretty weak - my referral charging credit ends end of this month, but i paid $4K for FSD being a ""loyal"" customer 6 months ago.   Honestly I\'d just put off buying a Tesla again til 2022 after model 3\'s creaking, paint, panel alignment, and alignment issues are corrected My app still shows a $7000 price tag.  You bastards had me all excited for a second  Total heartbreak This drives me crazy as I have to turn in my lease in august.  I wish you could just buy FSD as a future credit on a purchase. What about the X I bought 2 weeks ago and got the seller to buy the FSD upgrade so I could finance it.  Going to register the car today because it took that long to get the title and an appointment at the DMV. I have a SR+ with AP and it still says $7k for FSD. Theres not even an option to upgrade to EAP. Im I missing something? My price has been 2500 for a long time now but ok Hope Model Y owners get some love, $3,000 for FSD is right up my alley.",10

I see this far too often. Is that piss in a bottle? @TeslaAdoptSC on Twitter. Sign up to adopt your local SC and keep it clean. Wow, some people!  They need security cameras to catch people doing this, and then charge them a ""cleaning fee"" What pieces of shit! It\'s the classic ""Shopping Cart Theory"". There\'s no negative repercussions for leaving trash, but there\'s also no reward for cleaning up after yourself. So there is no incentive to expend effort to do the right thing except out of sheer common decency and sensibility - which can tell you a lot about a person\'s true inner self. &gt;\tbuys environmentally friendly car  &gt;\ttrashes planet What wheels are those? Right on! Be considerate of others and the environment, people. Trash leaves trash. I don't condone this behavior, but also Tesla really needs to address some of the poor conditions at many of the superchargers. I traveled from Tampa to Chicago and back last week via I-75, I-24, and I-65. There are 2 chargers we stopped at (out of 10) that actually had a trash can by the chargers. Even then, both were overflowing to the point where you either needed to set your trash next to the cans, keep it with you, or walk a considerable distance to one of the establishments nearby to discard it. It was more annoying for me because I had to change my kid's diaper every stop and it was 90 degrees out. 1. Pieces of shit 2. Will end up causing superchargers to have trash cans 3. Will end up raising supercharger network maintenance costs (someone has to empty the trash cans) 4. Supercharger price per KW will raise to cover this cost 5. Pieces of shit suck. **Ironic isnt it** Ugh at my university people leave trash in the parking structures all the time. In n out bags, banana peels, you name it. Theres trash cans at every stairwell and elevator for a reason. Pick it up. Its the way of the road bubs. I think this captures why covid is not going away anytime soon...people are filthy and lack sense of hygiene Thats disgusting. Matching up billing records with surveillance video would solve the problem. Is that a pee bottle!? We are better than this! That's disgusting. I'm not a Tesla owner so have a question....when filing up for gas, every station, every pump has a garbage can...do Tesla charging stations provide that convenience? Where is this? Ugh. I hate when I see stuff like this! I was looking at the tesla and trying to see what is wrong with it despite it not being in the middle of the photo. Then I was confused and thinking it was a trash face mask. Then I read the comments. Theres some assholes out there. Not to mention the other assholes that dont pic up their dog poop. See this all the time. Work at a major truck stop on I-5 and lots of trash cans around. I loose faith in humanity more and more Whats the issue with the shopping carts now? Never in my life have I ever thought to not return the cart wtf. Use it and then return it, its not hard, it really isnt Yeah fuck you if you are that lazy person that drops your shit for someone else to pick up.... I am sure there is a way to trace the vehicles that were using that particular spot at a particular time Further proof that no one likes kambucha and the people that pretend to are just douchebags Some shit in parking lots and other shit in the air we breathe, the planet is full of assholes that shit without a thought of the consequences. A dumpster would be a nice feature. Cleaning out the car while it charges for 20 min is a reasonable distraction. I thought he parked wrong for charging and was trying to figure out what you were talking about. The car is so nice i didnt even see the trash haha. Then I saw what a poor excuse for a human being did. What is that bottle even? Apple cider? Prescription medicine bottle? Yeah, that's bullshit.  It does bug me that the superchargers stations don't usually have conveniently located trash cans.  It's the one, albeit little, thing I miss from going to gas stations: getting trash out of your car is literally one or two feet away from the can. This is the thing, mostly liberal people buy Tesla to justify helping the environment, but leaving trash around is just the common theme here. Why is that, when you preach conservation, climate change and pure ass laziness override? Demonizing ICE cars when leaving your fucking trash makes more damage than any ice car.  I live in a solidly liberal state and Ive see supercharger  trash consistently. At the South City SF SC there's eucalyptus trees which attract birds which causes bird shit to land on all the SCs. It's a cars worst nightmare. I've been tempted to clean them but it'll just get shitted on again. Just another example of people being lazy at a Supercharger. (Although this is obviously not just a ""tesla owner"" problem)   I was at a very busy supercharger a few days ago. All chargers were taken. In the 30 minutes I was charging i saw 2 Tesla owners pull up, park, and walk into Burger King - without charging?  Then I have to watch people drive and wait because there is nowhere to charge. While 2 chargers are taken from people using them as normal parking spots :( man that y is beautiful Tesla owners: ""I own a Tesla to help save the environment and combat polution!""  Also Tesla owners: ...  Edit: can\'t spell Tesla I bOuGhT a TeSlA tO HeLp ThE eNvIrOnMeNt....  Nothing against people who, you know, actually practice what they preach. Frickin' trashy people.    Sadly, you can't tell what kind of person somebody is by what they drive. Savages should just not be allowed to own one. I can guarantee the trash is from non-Tesla owners. I see it happen all the time. The masks have been a curse at my workplace. So many masks on the ground and stuffed between items on the shelves... You can buy a Tesla but you cant buy class.

Whats in the bottle? Degenerates.  Send like make and gloves are the New litter items of choice.  I think some would be improved by incentivizing drivers to report litterers.  They have all those stupid signs, but as soon as you call, they ask if you would be willing to be a witness in court and if you say it would be difficult, they say they can't make the report.  How about this instead...  I have a dash camera.  I will give the state the tape, and they can pay me $25 or something if they convict the idiots.  If I have to go to court, I want more.  The fine is $500 in my state.  They can afford it. early Tesla adopters are eco friendly but no more-alas! The condition of most charging areas at hotels Ive seen in the past 4 months Seems simple enough to make it $100,000 fine.  Post that sign everywhere. Take away their access to super chargers. Woah, Model Y. Never see those in public. Why are people being fucking assholes like this? Hybrid driver for you. This happens often at the Southampton, NY SC as well. One of the chargers is even cracked and people put trash in the hole like it's a makeshift can.... This to me screams ""Dad let me use the car with my bois. SICK."" You see this all over the place in Oakland. I call it a car halo and fucking slobs do it all the time Ok, I won't buy a white Tesla :( thought this was r/trashy ... I thought only poor people and uneducated did stuff like this. I'm surprised it was found at a charging station. Edit: I see this is in California, from what I understand it's unlike the rest of the country. I know I'm late to the party but how do we know this was actually a Tesla owner and not somebody else? Their friends probably think wow how do you keep your car so clean? Yep, a few weeks ago stopped at supercharging station... and it was unreal how much trash was all over the place, including face masks. Worse, the charger handle was super slimed... it is a supercharging station with at least two reasonable size trash cans, too.  Inexcusable. Drives me crazy when people leave their trash. These are expensive cars, you can't honestly expect them to put trash in them can you? Fucking /S What is with this? I work in a high end mall in an affluent area, and I have noticed that this has all of a sudden become a thing people do. The entire parking lot is just neat little piles of Chik Fil A bags and water bottles everywhere. Who started this? I don't understand why people can't just throw things away when they get home..... Ok I wont Agree don't go for white if buying a MY. litter? 50/50 odds its piss. Someone give me insight into the mind of someone who would do this. r/trashy What's the big deal, it's somebody else's job to clean that up  /s Piss bottle? What are those rims? Surely: Tesla would have enough CCTV to identify the person littering, then simply ban them from the supercharger network for an appropriate period of time. what does that bottle have? that's a crime to leave a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 with barely a sip from your Model 3. serio... People. What a bunch of bastards. Here's the solution:    Tesla auto records all cameras whilst at superchargers. Video is uploaded and location stamped. Anybody can report a messy supercharger by pressing a button. Tesla algorithms will then automatically check logs of all cars that were at that supercharger (including the culprit). Use combined cameras to identify who, where and when the rubbish was deposited, then automatically charges a fee for it. User can dispute the charge. Tesla can then show the video evidence.    Nobody would make a mess ever again. In the Trader Joe's lot in Pikesville Maryland I have seen people leave carts: between cars, at the far end of the lot, and the lot for the Barnes and Noble on the other side of the driveway. I've never seen anything like that in any other place. I used to collect carts on the way to the store until a District Manager asked me to stop.",1831,"Anyone who does this should have to give up their rights as a Tesla owner and give me said Tesla- Im too poor but would never litter  With all the camera our cars have... Tesla should start shaming litterers.. upload evidence online for all to witness.. and then fine.. Imagine being a Tesla owner and trying to save the planet and you do some stupid, ignorant, and garbage shit like this.  The human race doesnt deserve nice things. Didn't even notice that stuff on the ground. Nice job showing off your x, that combo of white car and black wheels is just stunning Fine. I wont buy a tesla. To a Karen, the world is her trash can.   **Tesla - don't sell cars to Karens!** It is the one time that you should discriminate! Well the SuperChargers do NEED to have garbage cans. No way to know this was a Tesla owner. Malls, where a lot of these chargers are, are filled with a bunch of young punks! haha I hate to say it, but some people are just ""white trash"" (forgive the racial bias - just the expression); the fact that they can afford a Tesla doesn\'t change that.  I just got back from a hike and (as is often the case) I am stunned by the incongruity of people going out to beautiful places in nature, then just dropping drink containers, energy bar wrappers, diapers, etc.  I don\'t get it, but it\'s a sad fact. Honestly we don't even know a Tesla owner left that pile... it could have been someone who hates Tesla leaving it. Shitty.  But to be fair, most supercharging spots Ive been to have no trash cans. Theyre often a bunch of stalls at the far far end of a shopping mall parking lot.  Edit: wow, I got downvoted for pointing out that if you dont have trash cans people will throw their trash on the ground. I didnt advocate littering. People have urine, dirty diapers, old food - and when they go to a gas station theres always a trash can, but when they go to a supercharger theres nothing. This is just human psychology at work. Theres a reason there are public trash cans in streets and bins at gas stations. Learn from it. Oh yeah that was me sorry my bad Ya to this. Dont let kids in your Tesla. Tesla should reduce their vehicle's performance if enough people report them for littering at a supercharger.  Add a report issue feature in the app where you can submit a picture. Tesla can cross reference with who last used that charging station. If they get 3 strikes, they get limited performance mode for a week  Creat an algorithm for ""litter mode"" with a camera attached to the charger. When triggered, the vehicle identification will upload, triggering the onboard Telsa Security camera\'s against the owner when it is triggered reporting them (the person), the act itself (littering), and the license ID, date and time to local authorities for tickets. Or just ban supercharging to that car until a fee is paid for cleaning. Did this happen often before they started selling the 3/Y? Yet another reason why socialism/communism never works",45

It was a tight 90 deg turn, since I needed to clear an adjacent curb.  My Model X slipped an inch or so under one wheel. Odd, I figured it might be an oil slick from an ICE.  When I got out I realized someone had left a dirty diaper in the Supercharger parking spot, and my 6,000lbs of road force literally smooshed the poopoo into my brand new Michelin's.  I hate people I wish I could find them and throw the diaper onto their face. Yeah there's no excuse for littering, but I do wish More superchargers had trash cans and windshield cleaning items. Who the fuck do these people think is going to clean up their shit. Since the easing of lockdown in the UK loads of people have started heading to the great outdoors and then just leaving their crap all over the place. I can't imagine these folks get out of city much but seriously just leaving bags of trash all over the forest, beaches and everywhere they go.

Say a trash can, a vending machine or two, maybe windshield squeegees and an air pump would be neat. This should be a topic for @sentrymostwantd Never saw that kind of superchargers.

Ok so are you going to advocate against littering in general or only around superchargers? isnt there a trash can near by??? Obviously littering is bad but Tesla could use trash cans at these superchargers. In the United States, some of them are in the parking lot of gas stations which have convenient stores and obviously trash cans all about. In some cases when theyre in the back corner of the shopping mall, there may be nothing nearby. I still think its inexcusable for people litter but I do think Tesla should work out something with The property owner to provide some sort of trashcan. People are lazy stupid pieces of shit.

Also, so far as I can see, there are no jobs related to Dojo on their site...  With current tech and not doing a custom chip (AMD MI100 - 34Tflops), this would be ~$500m (or less) and take up ~275 racks, or about a 10-15MW data center. Thats about ~2500 3U severs with a full-bore power draw of ~3kW (2x CPU @ 200W, 8x GPU @ 300W, fans/network/mobo @ ~200W). Youd need several racks of network gear, but hooking up the servers at 2x200G would make this fairly small (&lt;10 racks).   Proposed server specs: 2x AMD EPYC Rome CPUs @ ~180W TDP 8x AMD MI100 GPUs @ ~300W TDP 2x Mellanox 200G Ethernet Cards @ ~30W TDP 1TB DDR4 RAM Cost: ~$150,000 MSRP each  Total Server cost: $375m MSRP   Then throw in a big CLOS fabric network using something like the Broadcom Tomahawk 4 (64x400G) chip, which would be fairly modestly sized for only ~2500 servers, as compared to the CLOS fabrics deployed by the likes of FB/Amazon/Google, etc.   Lets say you need.... 500 switches @ $50,000, a total of $25m.   Now we need to buy some data center space, power, cables, yada yada, call it it another $25m.   Final upfront cost estimate: $425m  However, Elon has stated they are spinning up custom chips, which has a large upfront cost, but could pay dividends in the future. Just read through all the comments and I still have 0 understanding of what this is about. Is it talking about the newest generation FSD Chip? Is it talking about Teslas own proprietary super computer they are using to analyze and categorize FSD data? Is it something completely different? Can someone please ELI5 this for myself and the rest of us normal folk? :) Is the NN output (sorry if I blow the terminology) portable to all different vehicle models, or does it have to be re-run for significantly different situations?  I'm thinking semi vs passenger vehicle vs passenger vehicle with towing vs pickup truck?

Thats some sweet sound This is silly. But this is also amazingly fantastic! Good rockets look like real rockets. Tall and Skinny.   neat design though! Sooooooooo much better than current starship. Current reminds me too much of real rockets. Because it is a real rocket. I want some star trek enterprise shit. Id be very curious about the aerodynamics of that second stage ship on reentry haha This looks very cool, and the idea of a triple-wide upper stage is novel.  If it could use three off the shelf Super Heavy boosters (vs. needing a special center core ala Falcon Heavy), it might even be practical.  Except for one tiny little problem: from where do you launch a \\~30 meter wide rocket?  This is where the [18m Starship]( really comes into its own, because it gives you 4x the tonnage to orbit with only a 2x increase in pad diameter.  Scaling out is not trivial, but it seems like it's less complexity than the struts and bracing for keeping the boosters together *plus* the custom manufacturing needed for that beautiful Starship. Damn, Starship, you looking kinda thicc. But Why? I feel... Extremely conflicted about this. Starship Spaceforce edition. The most epic ""You won\'t"" dare. You know... I'm thinking at that point rockets will reach their max end of usefulness and we'll have to start using a new form of transportation to get to space Dont let Elon see this it will be flying in 2 years if he does... How would staging look? Seperating the boosters from Starship and afterwards clear the boosters each from another? What kind of missions could this do? Like how much mass could this fling to Jupiter SOMEBODY DO IT IN KSP!!! Thanks I hate it Don't give him any ideas. Now THATS a Starship ""GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!"" Ah yes, Starship Wideboy. Starship, The Thicclyist Thicc edition. Russia with there N-1:,,Dude why do we keep exploading??""  Elon:,, I dont know but I am gonnna build a 3 core starship with  ""only"" 100 engines lol."" Mix n match! Elons making adult legos That would be so sick. I guess Elon would really like that if he catches that in his Twitter feed. Starship will take us to Mars, this MF wants to take us to Pluto Swole starship A triple core booster will never make economic sense, it'd kill turnaround time. Need minutes between flights, not weeks.  I do think the idea of a non-cylindrical stage is interesting. It wouldn't be as mass-efficient, but could have some aerodynamic advantages (maximizing surface area for a bellyflop reentry) and manufacturing and maintainability advantages (can be built on smaller tooling, and when horizontal more of the vehicle surface area is accessible in any particular orientation That's sweet! Nice design! Imagine how loud that would be? Awesome idea and artwork! That dorsal landing leg! Well done. Starship thiiicccc Ridiculous, but I'd love for a more advanced version to be this big. Someday! Starship Venture Star?? For interplanetary flights the design would make perfect sense, tho. It offers more volume per ship and the huge flat underside provides high lift during reentry.   Interplanetary reentries are notoriously difficult to survive because they are so energetic. You want to reduce your velocity by aerobraking to save on fuel. For this you have to dip deep enough into the atmosphere to you reduce your speed so much that you don\'t ""overshoot"" and drift into deep space again. But this heats your aero surfaces quite a lot.   So in theory you want to only skim the very top layers of the atmosphere to keep the peak heating low while simultaneously producing so much negative lift that you stay inside the atmosphere and follow the curvature of the earth until you have lost all your velocity.   You can generate negative lift by turning your spacecraft on its back. (heatshield still pointed into the air stream).  This Super-Starship would generate an astronomical amount of lift. Ok first of, i love this. Looks awesome.  2nd.. no.  This is really the advantage of the base Spaceship. It allows ships like this to be produced where they should be... in space. Launch say 4 Spaceships of materials, and another custom made upper stage, assemble the rest in space - done.  Much easier. Supporting space manufacturing will only help all humans eventually. Well, if someone figures out how to lay this on its side on Mars, we've got the first building for the colony. Damn it who let the kerbals design it Lemme grab my phone and make this in r/Spaceflightsimulator Upper stage would probably work better with engines in the center.  By the time it's that high up, you're not fighting gravity, just adding orbital energy, so taking a little longer is ok. Having 2 longer fuel tanks instead of one will increase fuel capacity and overall delta V capability.  Landing with engines spread wide apart could get overly exciting if one fails. Very impressive :) I don't think SpaceX is going for three-core again. Shit hot lets do it VentureStarship",600,"Well, thats a rather ambitious design..    Throwing ideas into the ring is always useful.  The alternative pathway to this, is to build a larger vehicle in orbit, and use Starship to ferry up to it..  I am inclined to think that a Starship 2.0 would be different to this, but it has some merits..  (And quite a few challenges to this design, especially from the coupled boosters)",0

Nuts!  [  New dream car right there. &gt; Coming late 2021  We all know that means mid 2022 is more likely. I just bought one! I'm very excited to see the details roll out over the next year. P100D X fully loaded was $170k with 289 mile range up until June 2019. This plaid S with better performance and 520 mile range for $140k is actually pretty good deal. Will that allow them to uncork the current M3P, now that there's a stronger S? Dude, those are awesome insane specs. I will be incredibly impressed if it can matches the Viper ACR.  That said, I highly doubt they'd shave enough time to match a Senna. Elon will revisit Nrburgring with a german made vehicle if he has any sense... if he can attract some performance engineers from European supercar makers or even F1 if he wants the ultimate roadster,  Elon even said a convertible  using the new battery and structural stiffness would be awesome  he does love Mclaren Cars. Let's see the tires... If theyre putting 1100hp in the model S, what are they putting in the Roadster. Honestly at this point I wouldnt be surprised if it was something ridiculous like 2000. 520?????? What Im glad theres some competition, even if they say there isnt any.

Cant wait for the Shick 6-blade for 140k they need to redesign the car. it feels so dated, it looks good but its dated. This might give us an influx of used performance model S at a reasonable price. The 911 at 1:28.30 is the first car on that list that looks street legal. ... you do know what plaid is, right? And what houndstooth is?  This is awesome.  I'm glad to see they are keeping life in the S and pushing the limits further and further. Those numbers are absurdly impressive, but the thing is... now show me the numbers on Lap 2. And Lap 3. And Lap 6.  [Because numbers weren't what you had issue with before.]( Its the same time as a p1 around laguna? The fuck??? This is almost insulting to people who paid $50k for a Roadster reservation. I'm kinda pissed. Man, I wish I could afford one of these.

The back seat in the X is great for kids and adults and you'll be using it. Performance X because you'll get most of what the Performance S delivers in a bigger package. The X is a ""truck"" because of it\'s weight.  Under current special depreciation rules, you can write off 100% of it\'s value in the first year (provided you use it 100% for work that year).  So if you get it delivered near the end of the year and only drive it for work purposes until Jan 1, you can depreciate the entire cost this year.  Might be worth keeping an extra vehicle for personal use for a couple of months to make sure you are on the right side of the law on that.  Talk to your tax guy about it, but there are plenty of teslamotorsclub forum posts about the Model X 1-year depreciation for business use. Have you test driven? With the tax benefits the X makes the most sense.  Plus the ride height.  The X is a more comfortable car out of the two.    If you have the need for speed, then get the S.  There is no substitute unless you can get the X Performance. Id say the X. Better tech, ride height and great for kids. &gt;Drop off 3 kids at school  This should answer your question: Hey fellow Utah Tesla driver. I had an S on a lease for 3 years. It's a great great commuting car and does fine in Utah's snow. I currently have an X in the LR six seat configuration. If you're primarily hauling kids, get the X. It's the ultimate car pool, kid hauling, commuting machine. It's also great for family road trips. It's a fun drive all around.  The S is also a great car so you really can't go wrong. It really just depends on how many people you want to easily haul and how often. Get the X I have both (CPO) - low mileage and both the best vehicles I've owned.  S is a '14 P85+, 34k miles.  X is a '17 90D, RED, 6 seater, 27k miles.  Love 'em! X all day. S doesnt even have door pockets. 6-seat LR X owner here. Get this one. You will not regret it. Logically the X makes more sense.  But it\'s UGLY, IMO.  And not in that cool cybertruck ugly way.  It\'s just weird.  JMO.  But, I would probably go X anyway if I were buying again, because now that my kids have outgrown the rear-facing seats in my S, we wish we had the X for it\'s seating.  That said, the S is way more attractive from the outside.  And slightly more fun to drive.  Definitely get a Raven long range ""plus"" regardless.  Performance is not worth it, IMO.",32,Get the Roadster!!! X. Model S is an obsolete car.

Your mileage may vary You gotta give credit to Tesla, they got a whole lot of people to panic buy last night. what kind of response is that? (Stephen King)  sounds like he has lead foot and just doesnt understand physics.    also my P3 is at around 8k now with plenty of tread left and I launch quite often.  what the heck is that guy doing with his car I had summer tires on my Audi S4 and I did take off at most lights. They lasted only a year and 8,000 miles and I was seeing metal in the tires. Got performance all seasons and lasted 15k miles Stephen King has been a great online troll for years. Maybe that is how he gets all his aggression out after writing so many scary novels. The issue might be the tire dealer. You go back for tire rotation and since you bring it a Tesla a number of shops want to sell you new tires - Model X is heavy it burns through rubber, electric drive burns rubber... easy to create FUD. I got this from the local Tesla service center as well. How low are the odds that the subscription will go towards a full purchase? Very low? I already put my $100 deposit down but delaying delivery until Dec.  Does that mean, my vehicle price is locked even when FSD or even if the vehicle price goes up? I'm thinking they are going to go with 165$/ mo for the subscription.  On the tesla site they price out the cars based on a 72 month loan so with that 165$ x 72 is 11,880$ over The lifetime of the loan. Tesla will make an additional 1,880$.  If they charge 200 a month then they will make 4,400 on top of the 10k they make. I don't see tesla charging more than that a month. I could see renting it for trips.  That would be really cool.  2022! Stephen King out there racing punks off red lights.   How do you burn thru in 7500 miles? Mine lasted almost 25,000 Subscription makes trying out FSD much easier, pretty good idea. well, are they fucking performance tires or not?! Oh boo, if I buy a tesla now I'll have to drive it myself, how pedestrian! I'd love to subscribe per day. $300/mo is a lot, but I'd happily pay $10 for 24hrs when I have a lot of driving to do. Prices of used Model 3s have already went up on their site by like 4-5k Guys. Its going to be $420/month. Why are we even discussing this? Tough call for me. $5k. 2.5 year old car model 3. Is it worth it?   At first I was excited about the videos, then I saw the disengagements, then I heard that it was just navonap on the highway.. I am not as excited but lets see. Are they still charging sales tax for the FSD update? Around the first price hike, there was some general consensus that they didnt need to do that (since its all software), but I dont recall anything actually coming out of it. Depending on the cost, I wouldn't mind paying for a month here and a month there if I'm going on a long road trip. I'm wondering,   if they do a subscription on a monthly fee or milage dependent and i just want to try it out, wouldn't they need to equip my car with the AP3 computer, even if i just want to test it for a month or so? Make it 49.99/month and I'm a permanent subscriber. What will EAP customers get? So any word yet what happens with HW2.5 vehicles when using the subscription?  If you buy FSD you get the CPU upgrade to HW3.0 and I guess it's needed for FSD... so can I get the 3.0 upgrade for the price of a 1 month subscription? I think the subscription should be per mile. The more you drive the more you pay and conversely the less you engage FSD the less you pay. Similar to any ride sharing payment schemes. DLC and subscriptions, what is this, an xbox? I have a question - what if I ""lock in"" the $8k FSD price on a single motor Cybertruck...and then it\'s suddenly not made like the Standard Range Y?  Would Tesla honor that $8k FSD price on the dual motor version CT? Increasing FSD price all the time is a dick move, it's basically making safety only for richer people. If you cant transfer FSD they should reduce the prices by a % based on how many years old the car is / how many miles are on it. I'll just rent then. I like they also.went with that option.",303,"Wait, are tires needed that often? It seems a little wrong that they're raising the price before FSD is widely available. The subscription is perfect for me for two months, the first is when I want to try it out. The second is when the car is for sale and say: Yes, it has Full Self Driving!",1

I dont know why but calling it FSD rental vs subscription makes me think its going to be outrageously expensive. I still think this is too early for a price increase. Should wait for wider release.   People are still stuck buying on pure speculation. $8k and now going to be $10k? Heck no. Not paying for that I wonder how the rental/subscription would work for someone without HW3. Would they need to pay to upgrade to HW3 prior to being able to subscribe? They should offer a trial because $10k is alot money.   I personally will never purchase this but I will put $10K on stonks So subscription. Maybe try it and see how it works Any guesses for the FSD monthly subscription price? I'm still trying to get them to install hw3 for me. Frustrating being sent overseas and not having any support for my vehicle... If he's insistent on a price hike then I think it's only fair to do so when the beta has a larger rollout. I'm sure this has been discussed a million times before but where is the value in FSD?  I don't see it as anything more than a fancier, more capable Autopilot, especially if the driver MUST have their hands and feet at the ready to take over at any moment.  To me, FSD has zero value until and/or unless Tesla is willing to pay my insurance, assume all liability and indemnify me against everything whenever the system is activated. 10k to beta test for them.. Musk is a genius Price will rise... then fall massively. Software features become a commodity. Eventually many people will offer FSD and then it will be a race to the bottom. In fact, in the future it will become free and standard. Eventually the price will come down once its pretty standard on all cars. I have no problem waiting until that point because I think legislation is going to be moving so much slower than the tech. Also once insurance covers using level 5, then it (should) be cheaper over time due to savings. Am not paying for FSD in its current configuration. Right now I have m3P in a couple years when cybertruck comes out Ill trade it in. Why should I loose 8K every time I buy a Tesla. I have 3 in total on my account. Some of you dont want to hear this but Tesla is like the best appliance and new cars are much better than old versions. I plan to upgrade every 3-4 years. Not sure why there is so much hate on the price of FSD. If you feel like it\'s not worth it then simply don\'t buy it. It\'s not something required for you to drive your Tesla and the default autopilot is already miles ahead of the competition on its own. That being said, I feel that many people feel entitled to FSD and are complaining about the price thinking that it\'s just a piece of software. If you\'ve ever used professional software tools in some industries (such as in engineering, etc.), You pay these companies thousands of dollars every year to use their software for work.   If you feel that it\'s not feature complete to justify the price that Elon is asking, that\'s fine. That\'s your opinion and it\'s ok to have, but calling other people stupid for purchasing FSD, ""pay Tesla to beta test for them"", in some people\'s words is just very childish and immature.   FSD should be viewed similar to other car manufacturers that charge u thousands of dollars for that Napa leather seats. Is it nice to have? Yes. Is it necessary to drive the car?

One omission I noted, was about the change in position of the LOX header tank into the nosecone.  But everything else was spot on, and included some information that I did not know of before.  The Lunar Lander variant, has apart from Landing Thrusters, a docking port in the nosecone, since no header LOX tank in that variant, nor body flaps or TPS (Thermal protection system), because its not going to land back on Earth.  Although this article is effectively a summary, I strongly recommend this multi-page article.  It really emphasises just how many design changes have taken place with what is now known as Starship. An excellent read, thank you for sharing.  One thing I am particularly curious about is why they stopped dveloping the 7.4 MN version of the raptor which I believe the article said had a nozzle width of 2.89 meters?  I would assume if Musk does indeed go with a bigger 15 or 18m  wide rocket, SpaceX would develop bigger more powerful versions of raptor?  I would think that solving the full flow staged combustion puzzle would be harder than for Space X to simply expand upon the existing raptor to make a larger variant in like 5 years?

Oh no, that\'s fake news. It certainly wasn\'t ""Big Falcon Rocket"". Jeff Foust, 2005:  &gt; The development of Merlin 2 begs the question: what is SpaceX planning that requires such a powerful engine? In past talks Musk has hinted at the development of something called the BFR (where B stands for big and R for rocket), a heavy-lift vehicle far larger than the Falcon family of vehicles. At SpaceVision2005 Musk disclosed that the BFR, in its current iteration, would use multiple Merlin 2 engines. The BFR would be able to place 100 tons in low Earth orbit, putting it in competition with NASAs planned shuttle-derived heavy-lift launcher.  [I highly recommend reading that old article.]( So much have changed. Other funny bits:  &gt; SpaceX right now has about 160 employees, including about 40 working on propulsion, 30 on avionics, 30 on structures, and 50 in manufacturing. Musk said he that while he would like to slow down the rate of growth the company has experienced since its inception over three years ago, he envisions that SpaceX could grow as large as 400-500 people, but no larger.  .   &gt; However, Musk brought it up after an audience member noticed during his introductory presentation that the largest test stand, nicknamed BFTS, at the companys Texas engine test facility could handle nearly five times the 3.5-million newton thrust of the first stage of the Falcon 9. One thing worth mentioning that there is rapid design changes/deployment and will suspect what ever designs you see now will most likely be radically changed, even with Raptor.  Exciting time to be experiencing all of this. I appreciate the nitty-gritty details of this article, but what really gets me is the big picture  Step back for a moment and try to imagine anything even remotely like this development program happening under NASAs usual program processes and contractors.  Its impossible. Very dense but a nice read. What it brings to light for a (relatively) recent follower of events &amp; reddit is that any idea we can come up with in terms of size, layout, characteristics etc has already been qualified to death by SpaceX's design team. It can be fun to speculate, but it seems it really is just to pass the time :) Great summary.  I still think cargo above the enginesnis a great idea, I wonder if it ever comes back. Perhaps its nor worth it but it would be far easier for the more massive equipment sent to Mars and the Moon. Great article and a nice summary after all this time. When speaking of payload size, it was interesting to see that they noted, ""a tunnel boring machine."" Something that was planned for Mars.",145,"&gt; The MCT tanker was noticeably different from the MCT ship, with over-sized 1650 tonne capacity tanks while only 27 m (88.6 ft.).  As a possible precursor to later hypersonic travel plans, SpaceX considered doing an Earth ascent tanker demonstration as a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicle, with reduced nozzle sizes and a 540 tonne propellant load.  Yay, SSTO for the win, don't let anti-SSTO people tell you Elon hates SSTO, if there's a way to make Starship SSTO they'd jump at the chance. &gt; Thanks to NASASpaceflight.coms (NSF) behind the scenes reporting, SpaceXs method of building it out in the open and Elon Musk regularly tweeting new details, we have been able to trace its progress through 12 known versions.  Thanks to r/SpaceX's + *lounge* behind the scenes reporting, Boca Chica Mary+Maria, RGV flyovers, some helpful leaks from people involved and more, we too have been able to trace its progress through 12 known versions.",28

Still on the surface of the earth duh if your standing at a point 6,120.5 feet north of the south pole. Then walk south one mile. You are now 640.5 feet away from the pole. This is the radius of a circle with a 1 mile circumference. walking east or west 1 mile puts you back to the same location. Finish by walking 1 mile north and you should be 6120.5 feet north of the pole at your starting point. This is what makes Tesla Tesla.

I saw it from my backyard. :) How many blocks does this beacon work for? Great shot. I love rocket launches, it amazes me what weve accomplished! Space is the freaking best! How in the hell that jet flame didnt wash out the rest of the pic is beyond me. Nice work! I was watching this live on Science Channel, their views were a little underwhelming but it was still pretty damn cool. I live in Wilmington NC and we watched it as it flew over. It was a pretty awesome to see. Oh that is amazing!!! Great shot!  And I love that SpaceX just sent four people to orbit!  Amazing company! SpaceX is rocking the industry and Elon is changing the world. I guess Im the only one who sees the dragon in the smoke between the water tower and jet flame? Wow you nailed this one! Fire in the Sky Lucky bastards...escaping 2020 in style. Great photo, it was pouring with rain here so I didn't see anything :( Beam me up Scott Manley Saw the stage separation from my laundromat in West Palm while I was watching the livestream.  First time I've seen it with my own eyes.  Badass as hell. Is this a long exposure? What an incredible photo!  We almost had a tornado here - nyc. I seriously forgot to watch this on tv Warp 8 Captain! Um..... Not even gravity can contain humans?  It is impossible to escape gravity. No human can ever escape gravity, it is impossible. Gravity is still pulling on you at orbital velocity. Staying in orbit wouldnt work if it wasnt for gravity. Aren't pictures supposed to be in the media thread? Nah that's clearly the bifrost portal ""I... am Unity"" you can't just shoot a hole into the surface of mars Impressed by how you've got one chance to get all the settings right. Proves it's more than just owning a good camera that makes you a great photographer! Coooool Oh right on, I love the Hammer of Dawn Heimdall open the bifrost! That is a Hammer of Dawn.   It is also cool as fuck. Nice post! Beam me up, Mister ~~Scott~~ Musk! Guys, I think the launch site has been glassed As heck not with the sky beam. Which civilization are we teleporting to Earth now with this sky beam? Damn check out the crew access arm. Its motion right at launch is clearly visible. Beam me up scotty Ive been playing too much Valhalla..  my first thought was what are those structures next to that wealth. Ahh... they laser cutted the Earth... again! bruh iPhone 11 camera btw What was done to get this shot?

Anyway If Tesla was to start giving away all of its profit to its shareholders, it would take you 1500 years to get the amount you paid in shares. A ""normal"" value is 15 years.  Even if you think Tesla is going to keep growing at an insane rate for many years, it is at least 10 times too expensive to justify it.  I like Tesla, I like its cars, but its valuation is more than a bubble. You would think that your material wealth and speculative net-worth is not the same thing .",25,As much as I love SpaceX I'm really growing to dislike Musk as a person,3

Its infuriating to see how much hate he is getting on Twitter for this. People asking him to spend his money elsewhere.

How will your engine survive beyond a few cycles? A lot of waste heat energy and end products will be generated. What you are proposing is similar to using a living animal to drive the engine. The energy density and output is very low. ""Newly-sworn-in U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to accelerate the development of carbon capture technology as part of his sweeping plan to tackle climate change."" - Get these men in a room together. Asap.  The thread on that tweet is absolute cancer. Just a bunch of retards making the same shitty tree joke over and over again, and other retards who are angry that elon is donating to solve a trivial problem such as climate change Are there any theories stating this type of tech could really solve anything? I keep hearing it could never work at scale well enough to make much of a difference. @ElonMuskOfficial It\'s called a ""Pencil."" Where\'s my check? Cyanobacteria Farming  I often imagine an indoor farming system I call ""milk bag farming"" based off the plastic milk bags we used to get milk in on the east coast of Canada. Basically these plastic bags would be made from biopolymers synthesized from the culture you\'re growing. You would just hook them up a hydroponics system, grow photosynthesizing cyanobacteria in greenhouses, and supply them with water and fertilizer. Once the bag fills, disconnect it from the hydroponics system like a plump fruit and reattach a new one, already seeded with its own sample of cyanobacteria. Then you just toss the whole bag into a chemical solution where it gets broken down into more substrates for polymers. Both the bacteria and the bag, too, since they\'re made of the same stuff. A continuously renewable loop.  You could even use transgenic cyanobacteria that overproduce the particular compounds you want, and have different strains for different polymers, or produce biofuel, or just bake it in a coke oven and compress the leftover graphite into bricks and build a 200 billion metric ton pyramid from them. Which is about as much you would actually have to produce to meaningfully displace the amount anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. (remember graphite is just the carbon without the oxygen) And would be thousands of times larger than the actual pyramids. Or perhaps we could make thousands of regular sized pyramids. Its actually an extremely daunting volume of CO2 when you do the math. If you were to convert it back into oil again, you would need a entire great lake just to store it. Elon is on donation spending spree mood rn the replys on twitter are so toxic We already have carbon capture tech, just cant do it at scale and with super speed. This is not nuclear fusion, so yeah, its gonna happen soon. But the thing is, who will pay to deploy and maintain Carbon Capture Farm (CCF)? Government? Because the private sector have nothing to gain, you cant sell anything from CCF, yet. I say we give everyone CO2 bug nets and have a mandatory hour each day where you go outside and try to capture some CO2 Have they tried not cutting down forest? This is cool, but carbon capture is unlikely to be solved until someone invents a method that is more-efficient-per-acre than growing trees, *and* actually profitable instead of costly.   I've read about lots of the tech people are trying to build. Some of them are very clever, but none of them are doing anything that makes them an investment instead of an expense. Hes like Batman but without the pussy mask. Thanks, Elon! Musk is trying to seal away Han Solo  Anyone mind explaining what a best carbon capture technology is? Tony Stark AF!! The CDR Primer is an amazing place to start to learn about carbon capture and the nuances of the technology: specifically siting, utilization, and sequestration.   [ For 100m I do everything. What about there are better things than carbon? To quote my favorite comment I saw on Facebook.  ""They\'re called trees"" So if I contribute with a tree I will win? I bet he will use it on Mars...

In truth, I think its time to stop speculating about the design revealed over a year ago and wait for the apparently significant redesign to be revealed.  Hopefully, it will solve some of the pain points of the original design while giving us all completely different things to discuss the merits of. The ""myths"" are a joke. If you don\'t get CyberTruck, just cool yer jets and when it\'s out you can either be a believer or give us all a fat ol\' told\'ja so. If you can get past the looks, the specs are amazing. Haters gonna hate, let 'em be. &gt;So you can't park it in your garage, just like any other comparable truck you might own. That's fine because this one doesn't rust due to stainless steel construction, doesn't get paint chips due to it not having any paint, and is unlikely to be vandalized since A) it would be exceptionally difficult to do, and B) Because it comes standard with sentry mode.  The main concerns I've seen about not fitting in a garage regard charging, not damage or danger.   While of course it's possible to run an extension cord or even have an outdoor charger installed, this does present some issues for many people, especially people who have already spent money on an in-garage charger.  That said, too many people are too worked up about a design that isn't even finalized. The ITS TOO BIG complaint pisses me off. The truck is the SAME size as an extended cab, short bed F150 in all areas except one. And in that one area its smaller. SAME SIZE YALL. I really hope legislation is passed to make the cameras legal as side mirrors. Im a fan of the look now, but I cant imagine a decent side mirror design. Does anyone know the legality behind attaching cheap side mirrors over the cameras that are meant to be removed? Ive heard you can use cameras instead if you change it yourself, but they cant be sold like that. For Europe, it will definitely be over the 3.5t weight limit (that is fully loaded weight, not empty) so it will only be allowed to go 80kmh and need a truck license too. The transit 250 is basically completely made out of soft plastic in the front. That's usually pretty helpful if you don't want to kill pedestrians instantly.    And just because a car is legal in europe doesn't make it sellable.   The transit is probably quite a bit narrower than a Cybertruck which is important if you want to use it in a city. And the 250 would be limited to 80/90 kph because it weights  above 3,5 tonnes. You will also pay extra when you use a ferry because that thing is over 6m long and you can't drive it with a normal class B driver licence but need a commercial one.    In short. Yes it's legal in europe but no most people wouldn't be allowed to drive it. I never understood the cannot park it in a standard garage. like what size do people think that is? If your American home cannot fit a F150 in the garage you don't have a standard size garage. Looking forward to watching the crash testing with the CT.   It might damage the testing equipment !      (not really, but funny to think about) The main negative is that I honestly dont think itll get here until mid to late 2022 at the earliest and because of how long the reservation list is I feel like its going to be very hard to get one for a long time unless you reserved ASAP because they have to scale production which always takes time. So realistically Id be looking at sometime in 2023 to get one. Very cool and Id still be interested in one, but it just feels too far off for me to realistically consider it. The one criticism you can't provide a solid rebuttal for is it's ugly as fuck. If you want to appeal to existing truck owners and pull them away from the internal combustion engine vehicle market (me), make it look similar to existing trucks. Of course, give it some Tesla flair and unique design, but this thing was way too radical looking and I won't buy it on that premise alone. The sharp contours are very unappealing, and I don't like the enclosed bed design, as it reminds me of the ugly Chevy Avalanche. The contours on the Cybertruck are so sharp, it gave me a papercut just looking at it.   &amp;#x200B;  /endrant.",77,,0

However, their advice/forecasts are still good if you were completely clueless about a topic. Because it's so easy to predict things like these...  Also being 1% off is actually not that bad so why the aggressive title? PwC had essentially been looking at how many they sold the previous year and saying ""that much"". The shapes of the curves are all correct. Predicting something that starts from such a low base and blows up is very hard to time so these don't seem like bad misses. Especially since over this time, like them or hate them, Tesla has executed very well as well which has sped up the trends. Not only by their own volumes but also by forcing everyone else to speed up their programs.  Getting the predictions for the next 10 years right is a much bigger test. There's now a lot more data to drive forecasts from and yet from what I see most people still think EVs will be a relatively small part of the market in 2030 and that to me seems like the big failure. For a lot of car companies getting that wrong will be a fatal mistake. Huge difference between Goldman Sachs prediction and Navigants. Navigant was close, Sachs was useless. Cathie laughs ICE's days are numbered. Nobody who drives electric will ever go back. Hell, if I had to give up my M3 I'd still go find a beat up Chevy Volt or something before another ICE. Are these bad estimates or are they old estimates? With more and more manufacturers seeing the light, I imagine these forecasts are getting a lot more optimistic. IMO Tesla gets a ton of the credit here with a nod to government incentives for EV sales. I am *not* wild about many practices of the company but there's no question that they made a great car. It was groundbreaking. Doing a luxury car and leaning into performance was product marketing brilliance. Quite a lot of the environmental predictions are doing better than anticipated. It's actually great news. Climate change is only one part of our impact on the planet and they're is always more to be done- but if we can wage war on our own flaws instead of each other, we might just make it. Honestly.

Having an extreme opinion whether negative or positive is terrible for actual debate and discussion. This a comment I left on another subreddit that I'll leave here:  &gt;Can you point out a commercial rocket with a similar payload capacity range and that is currently being used that is cheaper? The answer seems to be no and the answer is fairly obvious as to why.  Customers don't care as much about the hypothetical cost per weight as much as they care about whether the rocket is capable of taking the payload to the orbit needed and what the total cost of the launch is including insurance cost. Cost per weight is just a proxy. This is what is truly important because that is what is responsible for the lower price tag. I don't care if a hypothetical smaller expendable rocket can do it for cheaper if that rocket isn't being produced. As a consumer, I'll rather purchase an oversized rocket that limits its capacity for the sake of reuse that already has it's production line payed for. If I have a heavy enough payload, I can purchase the services of that same rocket as an expendable launch platform. Also, as a launch provider, I would rather have one reusable rocket that can cover a larger share of the market demand for orbital payload rather than have several expendable rockets do the same.",12,,0

They can have damaged wings, lose one or, for some planes, more then one engine and still attempt a safe landing. A skilled pilot can land a damaged aircraft in a river even when no runway is at hand.  In contrast, the Starship is running at the limit of functionality. Its engines are more robust then single use engines but they are not jet engines designed to take and survive a beating in bad weather. Starship's reusability means it can fly in less then perfect conditions but not by much. The margins are very small and a lot of systems have no backup, because it doesn't make sense with the starship design.  If one of the wings fall off an airplane, its pretty much doomed, but loss of landing gear, engine, fuel, and others and it can maybe survive since the plane can glide to unpowered if it retains a roughly plane shape.   Starship probably can surived a computer failure (has backup computers) and a single engine failure and thats about it. Propellant issues, landing gear issues, any control surface issues will lead to disaster. Its unlikely the starship could survive anything other then a soft landing on its landing legs. Maybe a water landing but if it tipped I don't like its chances.  To make up for this designers have put in escape systems to make rockets 'safer'. But the cost in mass for a starship escape system may be too great. But its possible SpaceX engineers find a way in the future.  Ultimately, we either accept the risk of starship for humans (after 100s of successful cargo flights) or humans will go up and down the gravity well on a seperate vehicle, like Dragon or Dreamchaser.   And thats fine for the near future, getting mass to orbit (and the moon and mars) is more important then bodies for now. And nothing is set in stone, if what is required for approval to fly the 10,000s of people to orbit that SpaceX wants is a new vehicle designed to maximum saftey then they will just work on that. Their goal is not to build the best starship possible, its to make life mulit planetary, and everything, including the crewed starship, is sacrificeable for that goal. Other likely redundancies would be:  - Flaperons actuation (kinda similar to jackscrews for plane horizontal stabilizers, but with extra worm drive) - avionics - RCS is likely double or triple redundant - Theremal tiles backing likely provides contingency redundancy if a tile would fall off. - Six legged vehicle would have leg redundancy - ECLSS would also be redundant  It's also possible crew cabin would be dual hull.   Less likely possibilitiy would be a per engine separate landing propellant system for landing.

SpaceX is already building up experience as fast as it can but has a *long* way to go to catch up to commercial air travel. And the safety of air travel comes from that experience.  Fortunately, the FAA *does* have experience. And if SpaceX thought NASA's requirements for passenger flight was stringent, they ain't seen nothing yet. While the FAA will undoubtedly have to make compromises for space flight  simply because the margins are thinner  I assume they will be systematic and thorough in figuring out those compromises, based on decades of experience regulating commercial aviation. Reading this post I realized...  when Starship lands for the first time after reentry it will be a new first.  &amp;#x200B;  * 1st spacecraft to land on a cryogenic propulsion package after atmospheric reentry.  &amp;#x200B;  Unexpected heat load to the header tank and cryogenic fuel lines are an additional failure mode to cryogenic propulsion package after reentry. This could pop a burst disc and lose fluids/pressure.  &amp;#x200B;  \\*Falcon booster does not have the heat load of deorbit reentry and RP1 is not cryogenic &amp; The SS Orbiter glided to a runaway after deorbit. I've said this every time this argument comes up. There's no need for an E2E variant starship to be identical to the Mars pattern starships. On Mars and the Moon you're forced to land vertically and you're forced to be really aggressive about removing unnecessary mass, but you can loosen those constraints for suborbital flight on Earth.  I don't see any reason why you couldn't build a Starship-derived spaceplane that takes off vertically and uses wings to glide to a horizontal runway landing.  It solves pretty much every safety and reliability concern.  Yes, the efficiency is a lot worse than propulsive landing, and you create a huge area that needs to be coated in heat tiles. The takeoff mass would be increased to the point where you probably need more than 6 raptors. But so what? It's worth it to have something that can fly literally hundreds of thousands of times in a row without crashing. 30 m of 15 G acceleration zeros a 100 m/s velocity in 0.7 s.  Which seems potentially survivable without serious injury ([pdf page 6-8](  So perhaps engineer the tanks as a crush zone?  Then as long as bellyflop and reorientation happen, walking away from a engine-free lithobrake seems not impossible? I know this isnt exactly what you are asking, but I think ejector seats would be usable from a descending Starship, perhaps even late in the landing burn part of the flight.",44,"As safe as air travel has a wide range of possible interpretations.  I think Starship at 1000 flights per year can be vastly safer then air travel was at 1000 flights per year. As most scifi shows depict, Starship transferring humans to space is a stop gap.  Consider that Starship will already refuel in orbit.  No reason that a proper ""sub-orbital"" style shuttle can\'t dock at the same time with passengers... Say Virgin Galactic style?  The final path forward is a different system to transport humans into space, some sort of shuttle that is either a very reliable single use system, with a drop pod to get back to earth, or a modern space shuttle (again, maybe Virgin\'s setup?) that has a specific purpose of only ferrying people into and out of the atmosphere.  We don\'t use semi-trucks to transport people, and we also don\'t use buses to transport freight (well, in a limited capacity we do, but I digress).  But when the automobile was first invented, it was used to do everything.",0

Seeing the dust interactions will definitely inform future landings. I\'d love to see some type of reference object for scale. I know the audio is somewhat synched up, but I feel like the altitude she was reading off was somewhat \'behind\' where the vehicle was at least towards the end there.   I\'d love to know how big the various boulders &amp; dunes/cliffs are near the landing site.     On a related note:  I\'m sure we will see better quality photos, but the still photos from the rover after touchdown don\'t seem to have alot of topographical features on the horizon. This surprised me since it seems like we \\*should\\* be able to see some type of cliffs or high dunes off in the distance, no?  Were those cameras just pointed in the wrong direction? Or are the \'cliffs/dunes"" simply too small and/or the landing site too far away for us to see anything of major note right on the mid-ground or horizon? I feel like this is my generations Apollo moment where we actually see the landing so cool! Wow. Coolest. Thing. Ever. Totally blown away, that was incredible. I feel like this is up there with Apollo 11 footage. Definitely something Ill never forget seeing for the first time. I was doing like a kid. It blew my mind! This is amazing!!!  What happens with the carrier drone? Im sorry I do not know all the terminology, do they just cast it into space? I was afraid that the footage was not going to look this good, but it looks incredible. I guess this makes the Curiosity landing not a fluke, these guys at NASA know what they are doing. Please mark NSFW because this is porn From fuckin MARS... This happened on mars millions of miles away! In our lifetime! What a time! Absolutely stunning footage!  So glad they went through the effort of putting cameras all over more or less just for aesthetics and getting people inspired about space.  I wonder if there's a view closer to the horizon rather than looking directly down. That's so amazing!  Is this like the first time we have actual video from Mars?!?!?! Amazing to watch multicam landing footage... from Mars! Its better than a lot of stuff from Earth! Is this actually the first true video from Mars? I dont recall Curiosity ever having sent a video back. God, I could watch this all day It's awesome how great the quality of the cameras are. I don't recall seeing Mars in video this good before. And looking up at the sky crane is sick Maybe the 2nd best space related video only second to the moon landing. Absolutely incredible feat. Im surprised the ground got so disrupted and pelted with wind. I figured the sky crane was high enough up to not disturb the surface? Wasnt that the idea? Anyone else got totally confused from the lack of scale reference all the way to the end? The micro dust formations on the ground really threw me off. I thought It was still a mile up and then dust started blowing. This is a beautiful example of how hovering in real life requires blowing a lot of air/exhaust downwards, something sci-fi tends to gloss over. Absolutely stunning! I got goosebumps. We landed a fucking drone on Mars.  I want to see people living on Mars or the Moon before I die. Then freeze my body until the Kardashians are gone. Amen This is one of the few times I can say that NASA has one-upped SpaceX in terms of camera angles and video footage of landings because by golly that looked so incredible I thought it was fake for a moment. JAW DROPPING FOOTAGE  Its actually rover dropping footage.. What a time to be alive. There's 699 people that disliked this video......699 people that can go suck a big red rock. ### Science This is so fricken cool, congratulations nasa and jpl, and to all the people behind the scenes to make this all possible!!! This beats every expectation I had of descent imagery. Im surprised they had the ability to return such high quality video! last shot of the copter flying away, with the dark sky behind it, totally looks like an effects shot from the old terminator movies Remarkable is an understatement. These things have a way of making one emotional. We've come a long way from caves  Holy shit. One thing to note is that the engines had no plume, which is interesting. Remember when they just used to throw their rovers at Mars in a big bouncy ball? I understand they don't want to contaminate the test/landing site but doesn't it still receive the exhaust of whatever fuel they are burning?

Had time to walk away = successfull   Def of Were literally on the cutting edge here. We went from Kitty Hawk to Boeing 707 in 50 years. He we are trying to make space travel like airline travel. This WILL be HARD. This is just another small step. Queue someone saying weve explored more of mars than the oceans and thinking its deep, or thinking it means everyone on earth has to put their time and resources into one thing... It was an incremental step, but as Scot Manley shows, there were quite a bit of issues still..not a single well defined point of failure here...apart from the hard landing and stuff, I think it also hurts a bit that the test article can't be reused and after three flights they can still not do an inspection to see how everything (engines, systems) held up...the bellyflop seems very well reproducable though...would like to see a bit of exansion of the flight envelope though (higher launch speeds/ more horizontal speed) When it flips upright before landing in that official space x camera shot. It looks cgi. I know it's not, but still boggles my mind at how cgi it looks. I cant wait to watch this after work!! One thing that jumped out at me - why have deployable temporary-solution legs? Why not just have them locked in place? I imagine the answer is that it would change the aero, but I would think that kind of refinement should be secondary to getting the damn thing to land in one piece. Listen, lad. I built this Starship up from nothing. When I started here, all there was was dirt. Other companies said I was daft to build a full-flow staged combustion reusable super-heavy-lift rocket, but I built it all the same, just to show em. It blew up. So, I built a second one. That blew up. So, I built a third one. That aborted, stuck the landing, and THEN blew up. But the FOURTH ONE stayed up! Missed the line of code to shut the methane valve to that engine?

The Raptors can't be throttled much lower and so Starship will be landing with one engine which is off center indefinitely. This means that Starship will not land perpendicular to the pad and the landing leg closest to the active engine will touch down first.  The current leg design is inelastic and so it deforms under load and can't redistribute the weight to the legs that touchdown last and it can't shift the center of mass to be above the center of the hexagon formed by the legs. It will always come to rest leaning over.  I was wondering if they could fire the RCS thrusters in the nose section at the last moment before touchdown to bring the vehicle orthogonal to the pad but this would introduce horizontal motion. Unless they also fire the opposite thrusters near the bottom and I'm not sure if this would have the authority to rotate the vehicle.  I assume that the hard landing caused a leak but if that was not the case and the vehicle started venting CH4 in its safing procedure maybe they need to wait longer until it cools off.  Edit: I just realized that several of the legs failed to lock in the down position and obviously this caused an uneven distribution of weight which probably caused serious damage to the lower section of Starship. I have yet to watch Scott Manleys video due to a data issue. Since SN10 RUD-ed after a couple of minutes of being on the ground - does the FAA still hae to investigate this? You just embrace the clickbait, Scott.  Embrace it.  Sooth your ruffled principles with an expensive balm made of cash and rocket ashes. Someone needs to tell the starships that cleanup and scrapping is significantly easier if they stay in one piece for the landing and dont try and make the disassembly crews jobs easier by beginning the scrapping process on the landing pad which has just been fixed after the last explosion. This video is great, but the comments on this thread are... not, so I'll summarize for those who may have decided not to watch:  * Scott doesn't speculate on the orange-colored Raptor we saw during ascent other than to say that it indicates methane-rich combustion and that it's different than what we've seen before. * Using known Starship dimensions and LabPadre's camera feed and frame rate he figures that the landing speed was \\~15mph, which would be much faster than previous landings.  * More interestingly, there doesn't appear to be any acceleration during the upright descent immediately prior to landing. My own comment here: You would expect Starship to either be speeding up (if there was a loss of thrust) or slowing down (engines throttling up) until right before touchdown, if it wasn't descending at the intended speed. To me this says that either the fast landing was intentional, or that Raptor wasn't/couldn't throttle up in those last moments for some reason. Maybe engine issues? Maybe it was already at max thrust and they were overweight? Software issues? Who knows, but this is personally my biggest question going forward. * The fire we see during the descent and immediately after landing appears to be originating from a GSE hookup, not an engine. * Scott uses footage from NSF to show that the second hop was an asymmetrical failure of the LOX tank, and that the pressure from the remaining oxygen was the primary driver of the second hop. The large explosion/combustion we see afterwards is probably an effect of the pressure vessel failure and scraping metal, not the cause. Scott speculates that the fire weakened the tank causing the failure. I will never not upvote a video by Sir Scott of Manley. Everything went as it has before right down to the vehicle **getting as high as it would at 4:20** before turning off its engines. Definitely an Elon company. This is an absolutely fascinating breakdown.  Well done, Scott.  I cannot get over the fact that we get to watch the space-sausage being made, in real-time.  Such a strange way to do R&amp;D.  Requires a shitload of confidence to publicly display your failures along with your successes.    (Not that this test was a failure by any means, but it did produce images of rocket-go-boom, which for a more traditional company might not be ideal PR for investors and the public.) Who wouldve thought that spacex could go from starship crashing into the pad and exploding to two flights of the same ship in a matter of minutes in only one flight why do they cut off two engines before landing? Scott does really good high-level analysis using the information available at the time.  He was right about identifying the recent Falcon 9 first stage loss as being due to failed Merlin engine.  Hats off to Scott! Scott is a fucking gem I was trying to watch it live, but after the first scrub, got pulled into zoom meetings. Later in the day I realized I still had a live cam open in a tab so I took a look. I saw smoke and some wreckage and thought, ""oh well, I guess it crashed again on landing"".  So I was very confused to watch the launch and see it land successfully. It was fun. And confusing. ""Google, do a backflip""  Elon: NOOOOOO not until we shut the browser of.... Well hey, it did a backflip. Im wondering about the videographer. Where were they to get such close shots while it was up in air? Close shots of fuel flames then right beside it. Was there a plane or chopper taking video. It seems to me that SM glossed over the landing burn shutdowns of 2 engines.  The 2 engines shut down with different visible characteristics.  That suggest that at least one shutdown was abnormal in some manner.  Comment was made that the 2nd shutdown may have been the abnormal shutdown, and may have been the engine associated with the external fire during final descent. But the official video had stopped the underneath view just after the 2nd shutdown, and the external flames were then observed to be originating from the GSE region rather than an engine.  So there may have been more than one fault, or a cascade.  Landing with just one engine was also described as 'it should have enough thrust to land' the craft.  I suggest that is an open question.  It may be that something was restricting thrust and the lack of thrust was the cause (that could have been mechanical such as a fault at the time of the 2nd shutdown or related to the external fire from GSE, or a software issue).  It may be that 2 engines were actually needed and that may have been programmed for, and the loss of 2 engines at that time was outside the software's ability to then control the landing. scott says that sn10 lit 3 engines then turned off 2 and land using one the way it was supposed to be   but as far as i remember, elon said they will lit 3, immediately shut down 1 to perform the flip maneuvre and then land on 1.   did elon change his idea ? or did they fail shutting down one engine immediately?   as far as i can tell, i'd say they did plan the 2 engines shutdown and flip with 3. According to Elon himself, its not an explosion . . . Its just a rapid unscheduled disassembly. As someone on NASASpaceflight said, it did a celebratory backflip. god i love scott",1514,"Other videos in this thread:  [Watch Playlist &amp;#9654;](  VIDEO|COMMENT -|- [|[+3](#gppfi9x) - I know, and I usually try not to nitpick about minor things like this.

For every tanker you just could send another starship with cargo loaded. I don't think a free return trajectorie to mars is much more full efficient than the direct route a normal starship would take. And the proposed 90 days to mars are incredibly fast for an mars transfer anyway.  Maby as an emergency route but then losing the tankers wouldn't be so important The returning tankers would be at interplanetary speeds and low on fuel. How could they enter orbit? If each Starship needs 5 refuelling launches, to get 1 cargo plus 3 tankers on TMI you need 24 launches. It might be a faster transfer, but I don't think it would be more cargo than just sending 4 cargo Starships as normal. Say the rocket has 100 t capability. It of course does not care if those 100 t are bananas or propellant.  These things though get kinda annoyingly recursive. So if you send ""couple"" of tankers with the Starship, that is three Starship. Each needs say five refuels on parking orbit, so that is 15. Each launch needs a booster, which is like three Starships worth of propellant. So that is crapton (63 Starships worth) of methane for one measly cargo delivery. Logistical and financial nightmare...  I get the feeling you are confusing latency and throughput. If you want to improve throughput, you do not send tankers, you send cargo instead. Three cargo deliveries that are a little bit slower is better than one cargo delivery that is faster.  Anyway say we have infinite supply of propellant and want to overoptimize. I previously proposed [this]( You could do similar to what you propose with Moon. Send a fleet of Starships to free return trajectory of the Moon to build velocity. Transfer all the propellant to one Starship afterwards. Use Earth to aim that one Starship towards Mars, land the other Starships. Now you have a Starship with plenty of propellant on the path to Mars. Two more things in addition to what others have said.   Starship is limited by entry speed at Mars. We don't know what the upper limit is but a fast transfer means additional heating and g load when aerobraking.   Tanker Starship will be designed for use around Earth, and would need substantial changes (zero boil off header tanks, solar upgrades, deep space communications etc) for your mission. Better then to just build cargo ships.   You can instead do most of your TMI into a highly elliptical Earth orbit, just short of escape. Refuel with tankers there, which can return to Earth immediately. Then finish the burn with the refueled ship. Entry speeds at Mars are an issue so of course. But this scenario has been proposed for missions that need more delta-v. One of the main problems is just the very long time these free return trajectories take, you are looking at least 2-3 years. A free return trajectory is also incompatible with a very fast transfer, a free return with a 6 month transfer is possible, but Starship will be aiming for 5 months or less.  Starship is very likely limited in how much payload it can survive reentry and landing with. There is a double whammy to being heavier without increasing surface area for drag: the ship has a higher terminal velocity, meaning the engines need to be ignited at a higher velocity to avoid lithobraking which means more propellant is required, and the ship is heavier which also means more propellant is required to slow it down. These factors are multiplied, potentially dramatically increasing landing propellant required. In addition, because it's less effective at slowing down, the ship has to dive deeper into Mars atmosphere in order to slow down enough that it lands on Mars rather than sailing off to the asteroid belt, but this deeper dive increases the heat load and aerodynamic forces on the ship, which may cause the heat shield or control surfaces to fail: thin as the atmosphere of Mars is, it has no problems ripping a ship to shreds if that ship is going at interplanetary velocities.  In short, the Starship will be designed with a particular volume of header tank and heat shield and control surface with a max payload in mind, and there will be no exceeding that max payload without serious redesign.

Crane you have to unload all that shit 'Most crucial' depends on the construction techniques. There will be people on-site so manual assembly can be done if making a machine telescopic is expensive or difficult.    For the first window I expect an excavator that will also serve as rover, hauler and lift with some interchangeable parts. The crew will likely be staying in their ship. They will need to build a pad for future landings and start on the earthworks for a settlement. An excavator is less efficient than a bulldozer, but it's a lot more flexible; that matters since we don't really know what the subsurface is going to be like.    I expect a mobile crane very early on as well, so ships can be repositioned as needed. That will let them ship very large payload items in chomper-variants without having to build a deployment mechanism into the ship. It would also let them lay ship hulls down sideways or cut them into sections for use as more permanent habs with better rad shielding (soil).    After that it depends on the details. Are they melting ice at the glacier and moving tanks of water, or are they hauling dirty ice back to a processing area? Rodwells, shafts or clear-cut mining? Is the main settlement going in as a quarry-style excavation with backfill (dozers and draglines) or are they doing individual trenches (excavators) or is it mostly hard-rock tunnels (TBMs and roadheaders)? Are they going to have to break up rock or will they need piles? 1) Tiki Bar 2)Tesla Supercharger 3)Excavator  4)Mars Regolith 3D Printer All equipment will need to be electric at first.  Heat dissipation for electric motors with higher duty cycle will be a big deal compared to earth.  Also keeping them warm when not using.  Traction may be an issue in reduced gravity especially for pushing dirt or hauling trailers thru sand.  Most crucial will need cranes for unloading and setting up, flat beds for hauling, rovers initially.  Assuming they would need diggers and haulers for building more permeant shielding and mining.  Probably some sort of assembly required due to starship packaging requirements.   All these problems are solvable but very challenging. I believe electric mini-excavators will have an important role in early Starship landings, there are already all-electric prototypes, using electric linear actuators instead of hydraulics.  A neat thing about mini-excavators is they can be small enough to fit on a Starship external lift, but can still dig down about 2.5-3 meters which is a great way to look for ice under the surface by, well, looking. Digging a ramp allows investigating deeper, of course.  On Mars you'd probably have a larger battery pack, like probably at least 50 kWh (charging by plugging into large deployed solar arrays, possibly roll out solar blankets before humans are on site). Much as with the historic solar powered rovers when the weather forecast is for reduced solar power availability you keep the battery at near full charge and run electric heaters as required. An option for staying at warm at night would actually be working at night, heat loss is not that fast due to the very thin atmosphere and quite easily mitigated by insulation and it wouldn't be too hard to have a comfortable equilibrium between the waste heat from the electrics and the heat loss: one of the harder things would actually be to do bursts of intense work without overheating, so probably they would be designed to work at a slow and steady pace.  One of the important things would be developing the autonomy software, which also has to function on a rad-tolerant computing platform. At least before humans are on site to teleoperate, the excavator has to be able to perform tasks like digging a hole without constant human babysitting (and even if humans are on site, I think autonomy would be valuable so the humans merely have to direct and troubleshoot). I don't think this would be particularly hard considering the state of the art in relevant fields.",20,,0

It didn't, and he was told SpaceX would not fly Monday (today) or possibly all of this week bc it couldnt get road closures. So he went home to Fla.   On Sunday, SpaceX was able to get road closures and they emailed the inspector to come back. But he didnt see the email. Finally SpaceX got through to officials on the phone late Sunday night, but by then it was too late to get someone there by today. In an attempt to be more efficient, the FAA has been waiting for SpaceX to complete a static fire, before sending the inspector so that he isnt just waiting around.   But its a fast-moving test program, and theyre swapping out engines and making changes on the fly. And so the FAA put in its statement that SpaceX must provide adequate notice of its launch schedule.  Then again...there are two (or more) sides to every story. No, no, no.  FAA bad.  Deregulation good. Can we stop with the conspiracy stuff now? It\'s kind of embarassing that every time there\'s even a minor setback it\'s because someone is out to get Elon, as opposed to the more prosaic answer of ""people mess up sometimes"". FAA employee here*... this seems very plausible. There is a lot of red tape not only for the stakeholders but also internally.   Most likely the inspector was send home on Friday after the scrubbed launch and was not expected to return until Tuesday at the earliest. We are people too and enjoy our time off with our family and friends. I usually turn my phone off on the weekend unless Im on accident standby.   12-18 hours notice is usually not enough time to get an inspector out to travel on a weekend, especially when we have no obligation to answer a phone.   For context, Ill explain... typically there is 3 people that need to sign off on travel.. the inspector to put in the request, the administrative officer to verify the travel and funding, a manager to sign off on the travel request. I can guarantee you that they were not ready to answer the phone on a Sunday night.   I get the hate for the FAA but theres a lot happening behind the scenes. For me, my mission is ensuring operators are able to complete theirs in a safe manner within the confines of regulation and policy, but I also need to remain within my work program and my other job functions and duties.   It can be frustrating for me sometimes when I need to get work done but paperwork takes priority.

You will need to install a docking station there, and it will still be useless - Starship is larger than the station itself. When trying to dock, due to centrifugal force, the station will simply be blown out of orbit. It is wiser for SpaceX to use the existing Crew Dragon ships. This is crazy and unnecessary.  Finished Starship is already going to have solar panels and radiators, no need to re-invent the wheel.  Literally just launch a starship, park in LEO and you already have a ton of space for whatever you want to do up there.

Very cool to watch!   Nice work. Those are some seriously great animation skills you've got.   --------------------------------  On a science note, I wonder what the level of the Coriolis effect would be, with that given diameter of rotation?   Would be very interested in seeing if anyone here knows if it would be enough to avoid inducing motion sickness? Really great animation, but I wonder about the challengers of keeping that many joints airtight. Excellent animation! However I still like the concept of a cable linking two starships together and rotating about the common center of mass. Starship is already built for acceleration along that axis and you can minimize both rotation rate and Coriolus forces via the right choice of cable length. Basic engineering requirements are robust cable and mount. Simple. the two halves seem to be identical. realistically, you want all the crew to be in one part, and the counterweight should be ~~something equally heavy, but~~ composed of cargo or fuel, something you don't need during the flight. that would practically result in different looking elements. alternatively, the rest of the ship can be the counterweight. anyway, the two symmetrical rotating parts is sus  edit: equally heavy is removed, see below Oh man, there is a design that isn't aware of the Dzhanibekov effect.  It would kinda suck if all the sudden the entire Starship flipped around 180, particularly if they needed to use the engines. I think the retractable windows are the most interesting and likely thing that could make it on a real SS.  Maybe not exactly as we saw them, but something like that that. Interesting. I might need to steal this general idea for science fiction war ships. They can retract the arms when going into combat to reduce their silhouette and make it less vulnerable in general. It's very pretty, but makes little sense: where'd all those trusses come from?     \\+10 execution:  +2 for science. Get rid of the windows. You'll get sick of the stars spinning real quick.

Math Just wing it.  They are sharing data with NASA, so they will have a pretty great idea of what they need to overcome in order to land safely Allow Professor Farnsworth to explain: Just like SN8, SN8 only crashed due to hardware issues. The software was bang on I would assume they just do the math and use data from past NASA landings. Plus I'm sure there will be some trial and error the first few times. Science How did spacex know how to do the belly flop all the way to the landing burn with no prior test? SN9 nailed the entire decent with no prior test. I suspect SpaceX will launch multiple Starships to Mars, each a few days/weeks after the other, so they get multiple attempts at landing on Mars. Same physics, different planet. It's a justified question because landing on Mars is a hugely difficult task. But they still have years and will do earth and moon first. I suspect they'll do what they've always done, crash a few Starships to get the data to perfect the landing sequence. Good question! My WAG is that it will come in a lot faster for landing - terminal velocity on earth just before landing is ~ 65 m/sec with no payload. Mars gravity is about .37G and atmosphere ~0.7% earths and there will be ~100T additional mass/payload well forward of the current COG. But with lower gravity losses and perhaps bigger headers I guess it could flip earlier and do a slower final touchdown?

I know I definitely wouldnt have bought solar from Tesla if it was mandatory back then. Solar makes a lot of sense financially, but it all goes poof if you add batteries.  The only good reason to add batteries is if the grid goes out or if your grid doesnt offer sell back credits or net metering. Wow.  This is a *wild* grab for margin and profit.  Between the total BS they pulled with the price hikes on people under contract, and now this wow. I thought they wanted to sell more solar than they are now and separate from that I thought they were way behind in cell capacity to make the powerwalls that people wanted.  I\'m confused why they would tie them together if those things are true - especially for solar panels.   I\'d get if they\'re limited in solar roofs that they want to maximize revenue for each one sold.  I\'m thinking that this is part of Tesla\'s play to get started on being an energy distribution/providing company - the whole ""distributed power plant"" kind of thing, but... I just didn\'t think they had the cell production up and running for this yet. As someone who actually grabbed solar + powerwalls, this is anything but consumer friendly. It's probably for the best. Maybe this will reduce their volume of installs and they will actually be able to provide a half-decent customer service experience for their solar customers. Yes, I know there are some folks who managed to get solar panels super cheap and without hassles, but there are tons of people who have also struggled through the process with terrible support.   I briefly signed up with them for solar panels a month ago and in 5 days I never got a response to my very first contact with the Tesla project coordinator where I asked some very basic questions. It was an easier decision for me to go local because a very reputable local firm only ended up being 20 cents/watt more expensive, and that's with premium solar panels (REC Alpha 365 with very low annual degradation of &lt; 0.3%) and power optimizers for all panels Probably due to difficulties with many utility companies.   &gt; Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home. Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid. I already have solar panels.   I have $25,000 ready to buy some batteries. I would *prefer* to have Tesla batteries.   But fuck me, I guess? I'm so glad I just finished my panel install with Tesla! I wouldn't have been able to justify the cost with a powerwall, which costs \\*more\\* than the panels with \\*less\\* subsidies (just the federal one)...  My goal was to subsidize my daytime energy use with solar and switch to a time of use plan to save at night (charging my M3 and, well, I use a lot of power at night regardless). Going full solar is a nice concept and good for the planet, sure, but if you don't plan on living in your current house for like 15-20 years, it doesn't really make financial sense at the current prices. edit: And also if you've only had one half hour power outage over the last 6 years. ""Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts."" welp the prices were too low to believe after all. My brother got fucked. Every other solar installer is rejoicing. So can you buy powerwall still? Without the olar stuff? My guess is that Tesla is getting murdered on contracting fees from local shops that work with permitting agencies and design the installation. They charge customers a fee that i suspect in high COL areas is probably not enough to cover the needed work and project management. They try to design the solar and powerwall installs without ever visiting youyou send them a few crappy pictures and they guess from there. I cant imagine that thats adequate. Im sure every other solar install is an expensive shitshow for them. Having a single high margin product (solar + powerwall) reduces complexity and is the best way for the customer to take advantage of what Powerwall provides (if you only want to provide one choice).  Source: I got solar and powerwall from Tesla spaced a year apart. It was a shitshow. Love the product, dont regret it. Is it possible to express how badly they've handled my roof order?  What a stain of a company....and, I can only take comfort in knowing that had I gone through with the order I would have really hated dealing with their crappy product, and non existent service....so the comfort is in knowing that I had the chance to pull out when they increased my price by 50% right before installation....many months after the whole process started.  Elon, get a clue.  You have morons running this company. This removes the option to buy for the purpose of saving money. The cost of the power wall will erase all possible cost savings over the life of the panels, pretty much everywhere in the US. This is very bad for consumers and good for them The problem is a lot of HOAs and other rules limit who can provide solar, so those customers are limited but want the Powerwall for backup reasons. This seems like a really bad decision. Thats lame. Was going to look into panels in a couple months. Dont really NEED the battery Literally had my Tesla panels installed today. Happy I got in before this change. I'm going to lay out thr real truth that everyone is missing. There is going to be government incentives related to this and they are prepping their product to align with it I just ordered solar panels and 3x powerwalls because we have pool equipment and whatnot we need to run. We have a natural gas generator but figure if we go solar we should have the batteries for the brownouts we do end up getting from time to time here in NJ.  After the fed tax rebate we are looking at $28K, break even in 13 years. I think this will be good (supposedly $41K in savings within 25 years).  It feels like the battery bundle makes sense but Im always for consumer choice. Ehh, figured lets just take the plunge, I am worried about a next gen battery getting announced as soon as these are installed but the alternative is to just wait forever. Tesla being consumer unfriendly...color me shocked! As an idiot- I thought you needed a power wall before you could even get solar like it stores the energy in the power wall for when its dark out? Can you still only buy Powerwall if you buy solar or roof at the same time? People are saying its so they can install easier and not have to wait for utility. But in california you need utility approval anyway. Takes 2 weeks to maybe a month.  Its gonna suck since batteries are expensive.  With that said, tesla is definitely on to something. NEM in california is reaching its end. Consumer are getting less and less back. And in other states there is no such thing as nem. I dont get why they are doing this.  The only reason I can think of is to sell more batteries, but arent they supposedly cell-constrained in their car business (and therefore in their power wall business)?  I highly doubt its to sell more solar panels/roofs, as I imagine this will lead to noticeably fewer being sold. This is to save money on the extra inverter, which saves about $2,000. This move means the company has realized that the decrease in cost for people who buy Solar + Powerwall stimulates more demand than is lost by the increase in costs for people who buy only one or their other.   I would be surprised if there are very many people buying just one from Tesla anyway. I would never buy solar without batteries, and this move suggests the majority of customers are the same. The entire concept of solar without batteries is also unustainable at scale. We need distributed generation + storage when it comes to renewables. One without the other wont work, because generation swings so wildly up and down. It was always going to be a choice between utility scale Megapack batteries or Powerwalls in homes ""Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility""  Latest tweet from Elon Wow, that's not a good deal in any measurable way. The price is already extremely high compared to the alternatives. Power wall is very overpriced. I am in the process of building a new home with 2600 feet of living space. I wanted to see what the solar tile roof would cost.  Quote came to 250,000. Two hundred and fifty fucking thousand dollars.....   Their regular solar is 90k and 50k after tax rebates. I thought every solar installation included battery? I would like to charge a battery of the surplus electricity generated during the day so I can use that in the night. If I don't do this then I have to switch to the general net once the sun goes down. And this costs money. Ofcourse the battery isn't cheap, you add maybe $10k to the installation. But aren't you fully independent then? Why? Doesn't seem like a sensible move. Educate the customer and let the customer decide. Idiotic! I hated my solar install process.  I didnt use Tesla.  The biggest issue/delay was getting Duke Power in NC to approve the install.   Utilities hate this one trick... your solar install has little incentive for them.   If having a power wall(which is already high demand&amp;high value) takes the utility out of the timeline, then this will improve the experience for customers.   Definitely frustrating if you dont want a power wall, good thing there are other options.  Tesla isnt BurgerKing, but as long as you like what theyre cooking, youll probably be happy in the end. STAY AWAY FROM TESLA SOLAR I feel like Elon needs to take personal responsibility for awhile like he did with model 3 production, it's getting beyond a joke and should actually be a big part of the business. I'm going to have to cancel my solar roof order I think.  I had only ordered one power wall, that's not nearly enough to make the solar roof make sense without net metering.  Sucks I think people are surprised at the the lack of customer service on the solar side of Tesla. That just seems to be the MO for the Tesla corporation This announcement combined with one introducing a hypothetical lower-capacity, cheaper powerwall would have been a smart move. Tesla need to name one of its product 'Defiance' in honor of company's performance against all the odds and negative news coverage.

The reason for this change is to deflect and distract from what is really going on at Tesla Energy. They are grasping at income straws and PR stunts after losing the majority of pending solar roof customers, myself included.   Why did they lose these customers?   Tesla abused an ""unforeseen circumstances"" clause to increase prices, despite inspecting my roof in person 3 times, my roof suddenly became ""more complex"" and this ""unforeseen circumstance"" was their pretext to increase my post-agreement price by 104%.  The Powerwalls are a profit center. If you don\'t need one due to net metering, they want to force you to buy one. If you want one ala carte because you bought solar from a company with actual customer service and better tech then now you can\'t. By better tech I mean more efficient panels, micro inverters or power optimizers instead of crappy string inverters. And by customer service I mean, when you are purchasing a $30K to $200K solar system, you might be able to ask a question or &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;GASP&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speak to a real human. In 5 months, I\'ve never once spoke to my ""Solar Advisor"" and he hasn\'t answered a single question. He sent me a contract where all of the critical design pages were blank, technically the compass was there but not the house or roof ;-) I was expected to sign this and ""trust"" they\'d build the agreed upon design.   Cars are great and for me that is where my trust in Tesla ends. 2 Very simple.  Many next generation high performance HJT and SWCT PV panels are about to sweep the market,  offering higher power per sqft at similar or better cost (LCOE) $ per kWh.   Tesla Powerwall is their product differentiator in this aggressive high growth sector.  The standard Tesla PV panels are cheap, low efficiency in the mid to low end of quality specs and by itself will be at risk.  Smart move by Tesla, it will remove challenges and support their plans for both their EV and Energy Gen/storage segments. So if we were already planning to get both, nothing changes right?",1032,"They just raised the prices of power wall recently as well. I thought that was due to a shortage. This bundling will only add to the shortage problem. Guess Im not getting solar after all Revenues from Energy generation and storage ( 5 quarters combined Q4/2019-Q4/2020) was   $2,430,000,000  Cost of revenues from Energy generation and storage ( 5 quarters combined Q4/2019-Q4/2020) was   $2,361,000,000  In total the was a net positive for the last 5 quarters combined by $69,000,000.     That puts the profit margin before tax at %2.84. I was hoping the math would show me they did this just out of greed but they did it because %2.84 is unacceptable. They have a shortage of batteries and the batteries going to power walls would make more money going into cars.     TBH home storage just isnt worth it with new batteries. Now when these packs from cars hit %70 and need to be replaced that should bring the price down significantly. %70 capacity means hauling around %30 dead weight but that wont matter if it is just sitting up against a wall in your garage.        Additionally I think Tesla gave Apple a net negative price for their upcoming powerpacks and the not savings is getting pushed to the small guys. It makes sense that its an integrated product. If you dont want the product as designed, there are plenty of solar alternatives. in arkansas you don't get paid for generation. there's no net metering.   so the battery doesn't save anyone money. Battery storage is super important and more people should have it - Texas is only the most recent large scale example as to why - but this is not the way.  We need to go the opposite direction, toward more modular solutions.  Batteries are still way too damn expensive to justify forced bundling at arbitrary sizes.  I would be much more okay with the announcement if they were also reducing overall price.  That's what's supposed to save the human race now, right?  Solar and batteries becoming less expensive?  Maybe this is what they're hoping to do long term, but I don't see how pricing a bunch of potential customers out of the market right now is going to help. What is the name of the company who installs those? I know they're listed on NASDAQ but can't remember the name This will bring so much revenue to Tesla in Q2 to Q4! next week my ass, the web page was doing this two days ago when i went to go look some shit up. Im getting tired of waiting for my 3rd party install and was wanting to compare against generac and noticed it said this So, they basically go apples way and create an exclusive tesla ecosystem?

This has the potential to be a good thing.  Assuming they are now doing a DC-&gt;powerwall setup they can get much more efficient storage.  The current DC-&gt;AC-&gt;powerwall-&gt;AC setup is definitely somewhat inefficient.  But then again, who knows. Must mean they have battery supply well under control. I dont understand this, so either this is really dumb or Im not getting it: Is it now the case that excess solar produced during the day will not get back fed to the grid if the Powerwalls are full?  If thats the case, that sure seems like a tremendous waste as there will be no choice but to shut down solar a lot. Otherwise youre juggling lower states of Powerwall charge and hope youve got enough in the tank when the lights inexplicably go out.   Or perhaps Tesla will partner with the grid operators to balance back feeding power from the Powerwall to allow a more consistent upstream back feed, allowing solar production to continue to flow?  Somebody help me be a little less dumb. It seems to me that a much beefier next-generation Powerwall is coming.  Is a current Powerwall capable of 2-phase power, and 240V?  Is it capable of handling, say, 200 amps?  Can a Powerwall handle DC input power?  If I'm understanding this all correctly (quite likely I don't), I think a new Powerwall that can handle all the above will be coming.  Further, I think a DC-DC inverter will be needed to handle the solar input? Coincidentally (or not), I think a high voltage DC-DC inverter is exactly what is needed to support V2G from a Tesla vehicle?  Edit: Additional speculation, bigger capacity and switch to Iron-Phosphate? This sounds like a response to NEM 3.0 (California) where exporting solar power directly is discouraged.  AC-coupled solar is only better than DC-coupled if most of the time, you want the solar going right on the grid immediately.  (DC-&gt;AC vs DC-&gt;DC-&gt;AC).    A lot of people will want batteries to time-shift their usage and get better utility rates.  If most of the power has to wait in the battery until nighttime, it's better to be DC-coupled (DC-&gt;DC-&gt;AC vs DC-&gt;AC-&gt;DC--&gt;AC). My PW is scheduled for installation late summer. I cant wait! So will the Powerwall be able to both input and output to the grid? Output to grid when battery is full, and input from grid when there's no solar coming in? Is this new wiring configuration worth waiting/pushing for with a pending install? I have 8kw panels and 1 Powerwall. Still waiting for utility approval before scheduling install. What happens if you have a combo meter/main panel? Id assume youd have to replace it with a separate meter socket and main panel?  The installation may not be that simple...",170,"Its been like 12 years since my powers gone out I'd love to use this, but Tesla is bait and switching it's Solar Roof customers.

What, if any, fine is there if that breaker panel switch get flipped again?  Flip it off on the day the inspection takes place?

Just got one, slightly undersized, so thisll be a nice bonus. This is huge. From a backup perspective, if you have two powerwalls, you can output 15kWs instead of 10kWs. Thats 50% more circuits you can wire up and maintain service on. That basically is the equivalent of three powerwalls, minus the storage of course. This is output power (KW), and maybe input power too  Not storage (KWH)  Right? Sadly that's no use for me in germany since the PW here is limited by the amount of power you can put through 1 phase which is around 4kW. I think this is one of my favorite things about Elon/Tesla. While they may miss their deadlines, in terms of product performance, they mostly under-promise and over-deliver. Props to the Tesla engineers Got three powerwall 2s in November. This is pretty damn cool. Wish I could use my three powerwalls to DC fast charge my car in a pinch!  I doubt I really would ever use it but it would be great to know I could! Powerwall is installed with 30A breakers though, so this update will probably only apply to new installs. I wonder if this is to accompany the rumors of DC-coupled solar.  Would make sense to put a bigger inverter in the PW if both solar and battery have to go through it. 1. This is awesome! 2. Hopefully the restrictions for buying solar + power wall are lifted next year once availability issues get sorted, because I have solar already. Just got 3 powerwalls installed today this is excellent news this is good news that makes me angry  i just upped my system to 4 powerwalls to ensure i had enough throughput KW rate  i don't need 52kw of storage but i do need 20kw constant load could have gotten away with 3 And yet Elon still wont let me buy one",233,So maybe now those of us with existing solar can order them again?

Well done. Congratulations! Now this is one EPIC shot!!  Brilliant shot Wow just WOW!! That is such a beautiful shot. I truly can't wait to see how the Artemis program progresses. This is honestly one of the best pictures i have ever seen posted to r/spacex. And i have been here for almost a decade. Absolutely amazing. So much planning! Wonderful capture! Looks great! That surely took some planning and math... nice when a plan comes together, epic shot. This is some r/nextfuckinglevel photography! Hot dammn that is beautiful  Honestly your best shot yet, and I have yet to see one from you that I didn't like. The composition of this shot is out of this world! Farkkkkk! Thats a beauty This is one of the best designed photographic works I have ever seen.  So much elegance, so smartly arranged in time and space. Looks like the Starfleet insignia. This is a picture Elon himself could not afford to buy. Great work! Awesome. For context is this liftoff (orange) and stage two (white) ? This is an amazing shot and should probably go up for awards. Congrats SpaceX and congrats op on the great photography. The planning involved in this though... absolutely next level, well done!  What a photo! Anyone know why there is very little footage from inside during launch and re-entry? Awesome take off!!! Keep us moving forward!! First of all, congratulations to SpaceX for another successful Crew Dragon launch! Secondly, that is one amazing picture, I find it interesting how much the arc looks like that of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. What an amazing shot - how much preparation did you do for this? :D titusville represent! Is all of that plume real? I didnt realize the first stage was visible during the whole flight Wow, awesome shot!  Can I ask roughly how you'd go about planning this type of shot? How do you work out where in the sky to expect the arc to appear? Are there tools to help out with this?  Super impressive. What a shot!!! Congrats and thank u The dynamic range in this photo is absolutely surreal. GREAT shot OP!! What the right side of the arc? Second stage or the reentry burn of the first stage? Holy crap! I almost never comment, but this is so incredibly good I feel the need to express it like this. I also just checked out your website, and your other photos are just as high quality. Awesome. So which color is the launch and which is re-entry? Could you bear with my ignorance, and explain what the blue streak is? Thank you! Incoming DisneyPark Mind-blowing shot. Makes me incredibly sad I couldn't get off work to make it over there this morning. Wow. No words. Stunning pic  This is one of the most incredible shots Ive ever seen! I cant imagine the level of planning that went into this! Is that the park with all of the hand prints? We were amazed at how small the Apollo astronauts were. Helluva shot!  Nice work! Space View Park and the associated plaques in this picture are a must see for anyone in the area.   The center piece, is amazing, and documents our entire history from flight to space. Major milestones, etc.   The plaques around the perimeter are memorials to any 'space worker' who died on the job, who they were, how they died, when.   Very very cool place. I cannot wait to go back to FL for another launch, hopefully Starship. Avengers !? Shot of the year Definitely your style ... gorgeous! Why are the trails from different colors ? I can't figure it out... I like how you got even Polaris the North Star in the image as well. Wow. Amazing shot, beautiful I shouldnt have waited so long to leave a description of this shot, because most people wont see it. Ive just been busy the last couple days. But for anyone who comes across this later, here goes:  This Apollo monument is at Space View Park in Titusville. Its a pretty cool place to visit. Ive lived here on the Space Coast four years and this was my first time there. Well, technically my second time, because I went there the day before to scope it out. Anyway, those pillars around the outside have the handprints of a bunch of astronauts from back in the day. Its definitely worth a visit for any space fan.   A lot of folks have commented about how much planning this must have taken, and I have to be honest, there wasnt all that much planning involved other than scoping out my spot. It did take me quite a while to decide exactly where to set the camera, but I really just went off instinct. Ive seen a lot of launches in the few years Ive lived here, and thats given me a pretty good idea of how high up in the sky the rockets go from the perspective of a few miles away (15 miles in this case). Its not always exactly the same, of course, but the crewed flights follow a somewhat similar trajectory to Starlink launches, and weve seen a *ton* of those. So yeah, I just made an educated guess. I knew where the launch pad was, and I knew what direction Falcon would be flying.   As soon as I saw main engine cutoff, I stopped the first exposure, and frantically changed my aperture to a setting that would gather more light, and started a second exposure. If I hadnt done that, the white part wouldve been much dimmer.   Side note for those who dont understand what theyre seeing: It was dark on the ground because it was still an hour before sunrise. The white part is when the rocket had risen up into sunlight, and the exhaust plume was being backlit by the sun against a dark sky. And because it was a long exposure, the light from its traverse across the sky was all imprinted on the camera sensor.   Ok, so I left that second exposure running until the second stage was out of sight. I took the two images and layered them to show both phases of flight in the same image. And there you have it! If you have any other questions about this photo, feel free to ask.   I did a re-edit once I was home on my computer, and I think its much better. Its available on my website for print, or just seeing the final product. I also have a 20% discount with the promo code CREW2. No pressure to buy a print, but I would like to know what folks think about the newer edit.",583,Whoooo damn. Nice shat!!,0

The SpaceX web site is tremendously uninformative. Id love to find an app that would send me timely notifications. On SpaceXNow I have all the notifications turned on ... and nothing!? Can anyone help? Nothing gets the public more excited about going to space than watching a good live launch, especially of people. I do get to watch many Starlink launches on YouTube, usually Everyday Astronaut, but thats not the kind of excitement that things related to exploration raises and Im not able to spend all my days checking YouTube to see if theres something each day.

I wonder how many future engineers this launch will inspire. God speed ! Great shot, Op! Your picture pretty much encapsulates my experience of watching from Port Canaveral this morning. Well done! well yeah... it launched 5AM this morning This is an awesome picture how did it form that arch looking thing? it looks awesome Beautiful Wow! Where is the launching site? Amazing photo! Im so glad the weather was this nice, for them and the photo. I dont know if Im just dense or if it just difficult or unavailable to find out when launches are happening.   I have SpaceXNow but yesterdays launch wasnt even listed. I do Google searches regularly for when launches are happening (like Starships) and what comes up tends to be singularly unspecific. The SpaceX web site is tremendously uninformative. Id love to find an app that would send me timely notifications. On SpaceXNow I have all the notifications turned on ... and nothing!? Can anyone help? Nothing gets the public more excited about going to space than watching a good live launch, especially of people. I do get to watch many Starlink launches on YouTube, usually Everyday Astronaut, but thats not the kind of excitement that things related to exploration raises and Im not able to spend all my days checking YouTube to see if theres something each day. Starship SN15 on SpaceXNow just says, NET Apr 2021. There must be more status than that available somewhere.   Anyway, any information to help would be appreciated.",46,It was just a launch same as every other space x launch. Starship launch will be breathtaking but falcon 9 is just a usual thing nothing that exciting anymore.,4

I thought I saw a Soyuz crew capsule docked too. At least it looked like one? Do they do this long, many sequence tasks to get the astronauts off of the Russian's Soyuz spacecraft whenever it docks with the ISS or do they just dock and open the hatch and go in? It seems like they arrived much faster than usual. Video on Youtube, in case you missed the docking like me.

It will have to be aware of emergency vehicles that may not visible but have their siren on.  If it's caught in traffic, blocked by an accident that won't be cleared for hours, it will have to manage backing up and turning around with other cars to get out off the street. This may be a verbal instruction  from a policeman and the car will somehow have to understand and follow the instructions.  It's going to a long time before a real level 5 car will be available. It's much more than just being able to drive in traffic. Elon is the Deepak Chopra of autonomous driving +3 years. This is code for, we still have Sssoooooo much more work to do than we anticipated... Tesla 2014: for $10,000, your car will drive itselfIN THE FUTURE   Tesla 2025: for $10,00, we Ill invest your money in crypto, and use that interest to pay a human driver who will take you wherever you want to go. Full autonomy. Cool, right? I've wondered why they don't use generated synthetic datasets. You could data connect, learn, test with a ton of generations, and reinforce learn. Kinda like a CNN. I wonder what they do in the pre hardware level. The Dogefather buys Apple since they have the chip and its software complete project, code name i I interpret his statement as L5 isnt coming anytime soon because theres a ton more really hard work to do Translation, some human drive good, robot not drive so good. we make robot drive like human within 1-100 years If Elon would have just kept his mouth shut and Tesla just sold the actual features of autopilot along the way wed all be amazed at the progress... instead it was an epic over promise and under deliver and now hes wrecked all credibility Yeah fine people are being upset that it's delayed .. so what?   I can hardly imagine the competition even know what those problems are.. Tesla is still way ahead! It only took 8 million years to develop our biological neural nets So sick of his overpromising BS he's not wrong.   basically, he's saying that Tesla has to be the pioneer here.   there's no other major initiative like this that i know of. in my view this is the first real application of AI.   a computer is taking in visual data like a human would. it's processing that data. making decisions based on the data the exact same way a human would. okay so beta 9 when? Youre almost better off completely redesigning and rebuilding the highway infrastructure to allow semi-autonomous vehicles. Would probably be faster. Need to be able to tell the difference between a paper bag and a small child...  makes sense that just seeing an object is there isn't enough, need to know what it is to determine if its worth slamming the brakes.",692,"Before thinking about L5 they need to Crack the AI Code first. And when you check wich company is leading in this field you will definetly not find Tesla on it.. We are speaking of Google, Microsoft, FB etc... Thats Probaly the most difficult Software Problem in the World. And you say Tesla can solve this problem??? They cant even get a profitable quarter with their car sales.. Lmfao... DoJO will definetly not Solve this Problem. Translation:  unsupervised means no hd map or no smart roads.  In Tesla\'s approach, the cars drive by gathering all the information necessary around themselves by themselves.  Cars that need hd map etc are relying on information gather by something external to the cars. There is no ""self"" in these other driving system. Not suggesting that they are not good enough in a lot of situations but are people really going to be satisfied with that? I see too many comments focusing on Elon Musk's public comments. But first this is exactly what they are not promises, not statements, if you know him a little bit you know that. Then instead of focusing on his tweets and wrongly timed objectives see what his companies have done so far. Everyone in car manufacturing and space industry is trying to catch up with him or his employees concepts.",12

It will never return to LEO as it will not have enough fuel. You can't make methane on the moon so it will always be a one trick pony.

How is that ""finally"". Also...they only started launching them in December 2020. Just...wow! it looked like it landed at the verrrry edge of the landing concrete. it was almost touching dirt The children over at our favorite ""we hate elon"" sub are going nuts trying to downplay this. It\'s hilarious. The children over at our favorite ""we hate elon"" sub are going nuts trying to downplay this. It\'s hilarious. Will SN15 be able to fly again? He missed an r. It's norminal. Tense moment with that stubborn fire. Holding my breath for several minutes. Is it expected that they will retire SN15 or relaunch it? Remember the date, we seen this, we watched it live. Years from now humankind will look back on this Rocket the way we look back at the Saturn V, and I for one can't wait to be a part of it. Indeed, it seemed like they had better control with two engines all the way down. Or the thrust of neither engine was high enough for one to be shut down. Just watched the video.  Loved the separately gimbling Raptors. So, fly 15 again or move on to 16? Landing a starship is impossible until it isn't. PLEASE Jeff please tweet welcome to the club again at Elon for this landing I want to see the ratio Dumb questions ahead: What do they do now with SN15? Do they tear it down and incorporate the data they got from this starship into SN16? A few feet off to the side though and, uh oh. Awesome job Spacex! I hope Im still alive to see humans on Mars. Make it so! To the moon! They say you have to fail before you can succeed. Kudos SpaceX for learning from your failures! Was a 2-engine flip? Why did they skip from 11 to 15? I\'ve been peeking through my fingers every time they test this buuuut this time I jumped out of my seat screaming ""YES YES YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!"" as if I was watching a soccer game.  There\'s an incredible sense of relief washing over me right now because this feels exactly like what happened when they stuck the first Falcon landing.  Now let\'s see if they can do this a few more times, up up and away and back again! Anyone know what the fire on the ground was after it landed? WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I'm so happy about this. Most of the family was watching it live. This will probably be looked back on as one of the most important steps of human spaceflight. Now to make this as routine and boring as possible, then the future is reall here Dammit, Elon.  The word is 'norminal'! that was great how come I can't find any launch threads, only the successful landing thread? Thought I would leave this here Dynetics : ... shit. Thank you SpaceX!! Watched it with my father!  Bring on SN16!! So... What happened to SN11-SN14? Last one I saw before this was 10 failing. Starship Stuck the landing! ""this is fine."" Did anybody notice some small explosions about 45 seconds after landing? (13:19 on the SpaceX stream). It was a few bangs and flashes of light under the skirt. Possibly related the one of the Raptors not lighting for the flip? Hah! Tell that to Twitter lol Watched it live. I was downright overjoyed when I saw it land! I can't help but get slightly teary eyed when I see these experiments. I have been watching with my daughter and I have such incredible awe at the future they will get to experience It finally happened! Historical! Congrats SpaceX Stuck the landing. Serious landing, dude! You are the man! Making my days worth living you are! Congratulations to you and all those at Spacex and beyond! Out of the loop... what happened? *norminal Lets go to Mars. What's the likely hood that they will refly SN15? Or will it just get pulled apart for analysis like the early landed falcon 9's? Whenever I tell my friends that were getting humans on Mars in the next few years they dont believe me. Mars here we come!! Stuck the landing. Watched it from the deck... Then clouds... Then heard it fly for 4 to 5 min. Then.. Silence.  Until, a glimpse, flip, light and land.  Well done! They actually did it! They've stuck the landing and the rocket didn't turn bomb! Once again, SpaceX has proven it possible in spite of the doubters. Now it's just a matter of refinement. Next stop: Superheavy hop It's incredible how simple they made that look. Aye Verb... im unsure on other models Big step  Wooo! I cant wait to see one of these on the moon, or even mars! Spending 1 minute on twitter and I already have cancer, watching all the bots spamming. Why are people using that platform, again? Norminal! Suggestion: When Elon walks out in front of the cameras on SNL, play Babylon Zoo's *Space, Man*, just to see his reaction. Amazing landing, well done to all at SpaceX for making this happen. They must be ecstatic. :-) Boca Bingo - where did SN15 land on the pad? Very close to the edge, that's where, and nobody guessed the tile correctly either: These are exciting times creating fantastic memories to file away; Starhoppers big hop, SN5s big hop, SN8s belly flop and flip, and now SN15s landing. Now weve got BN2, then SN20b/BN3... it just keeps coming! I just woke up after staying up late watching the landing, i was way too nervous to sleep, but i just had a feeling that if SN 15 had no aborts then it was landing and it did.  To see SN 15 still stand is just amazing but most of all i am so happy that this happened with the new version of autogenous pressurization, helium was never really the way forward and messed up SN 10's landing, so the fact that these changes worked means all is good for SN 16 to 18.  If they still could not pressurize the tanks right, then fixes could only be made on SN 20 at the earliest, but it worked, it heccin worked i am so happy congrats to the SpaceX team You guys are the reason i work hard in school so i can join you in a spacefaring future. Now that we have daylight SN15 can be seen on Nerdle (currently the only live feed for anyone who wants to see SN15):    A pity that the test nose cone is obscuring most of SN15 of course. :) Any speculation or information on how they solved the header tank problems.  Fuel supply did not seem to be an issue on restart and landing.  Neither did intrusion of Helium into the fuel.  It appeared to me that there were large helium tanks inside the skirt for pressurization, can anyone confirm that is what I saw? Forgive me if this has been asked, I scanned through and did not see a question. Man that was so fricken awesome to see them finally land a starship. We all said that sn15 could be the one and it was.  Now I have a question. How do you think they can account for the different CGs or pivot points when landing if they're bringing cargo down from space? Hey, what creates a flame on the outside around the engine skirt that comes out of the hull joint? Good. Can't wait until customers start ordering Starship flights so watching this is routine. Congrats! ... a proof-of-concept of the flip and soft land accomplished.  This was arguable the biggest challenge in the program as it was extremely novel and highly non-linear.  Re-use probability just when way up! Whats great is that they can try to replicate the test again with the same rocket! Awesome!! Does anyone else see this landing and think of the scene from Austin Powers? They better save this and put it on display at their HQ like they did with that falcon 9 that landed. Or atleast put it up for donation and see if any museum takes it What were they supposed to be testing with those tiles?  There were a lot more this time.   Couldnt have been any heat. Whether they would fall off or crack? I would love to know what happened with the third engine though. I have goosebumps! Realistically, how many launches/landings do you think it will take before SpaceX can say they have ""perfected"" the process enough to start doing missions that involve orbital flights, then refueling, etc?  I think that at least 10-12 launches/landings will be required, including reflights with the same engines.  If SpaceX wants to deploy (for example) 600+ Starlink satelites on a single mission, can this be done with just one Superheavy boostoer+ one Starship? Could this happen in 2022 ? Jeff Who? So what will they do with SN15 now that it survived? Refly or scrap it? ON MEGA DISCOUNT LITERALLY EASIEST 4-5x overnight ever",5587,"What about the pad fire? Can someone point me to some examples of today\'s flight being ""smoother"" then previous flights? Like what specifically about this was smoother and more refined, I thought most of the other test flights hit the center of the pad where is this one was right at the edge. Don\'t get me wrong, this was freaking amazing, but I didn\'t see some drastic improvement visually (aside from landing, of course) that many other people are seeing. To nitpick the landing it was quite close to the edge of the pad. The plan was to start 3 engines then go the 2 then 1, instead, I just saw 2 engines ignite and stay lit. The was also an after landing fire of unnerving size and duration.  But apart from that, we did not see any of those engine fires during the flight and after landing the landing gear seemed even and fine, great! If they tried to restart 3 engines and only could 2, they probably still have a problem to solve. It could be a problem they can put off solving, but you want reliable re-ignition.  Maybe finally getting the whole vehicle back this time will help them advance the issue. Next step: better employee pay? lol, those three words are engineering speak for ""we lost so much redundancy we shit our pants but by god, *technically* mission accomplished"" I didn't know he had time for space x. Thought his new job was being a crypto pumper Nominal?  Based on the flames coming off the engines post-landing, are we *really* sure it was ""nominal""? Pay your taxes",67

Exciting times, and this landing makes me doubly optimistic the team can pull it off! Pretty impressive. Genuinely surprised, did not expect this to go so well on such an early attempt.

Which is now the shitty old Fremont facility that's supposed to be holding them back. 3 microns maybe, 6 microns definitely. Sounds kind of like kaizen (constant improvement) and eliminating mura (variance). But the Toyota Production System is like grandma with a walker according to Elon. And what is this supposed to mean? I'm going their QC will be better. But it'll only apply to Europe. I think hes talking about the thickness of the paint  (stolen from [greentheonly]( thought (several) cm was their current level of precision Maybe for initial production. Dont know about the major production ramps. I dont know why Elons thinking its cool to have high precision. It should have been like that from the beginning. ah, where have we heard that before... The cars are great, but when he makes statements like this and then fails to meet the goal, it makes them look bad. Anyone remember his precision comments about the 3? Look how that turned out. How many microns though?  100 maybe, 1000 definitely? Elon has tweeted that Tesla has aimed for many things, most of them missed. Features, release dates, robotaxi fleets.   I'm sure this will be different. Mother fucking Elon, I""ll settle for millimeters now if that\'s alright with you. Forget the tolerances, could we increase the thicknesses some for the paint?  I think pretty much everyone would like it to be more durable. I think Ill believe it when I see it. Some 3s and Ys that have been built pretty recently that Ive seen have still had weird panel gaps issues.   None were so bad that would stop me from buying the car, but its definitely disappointing. These issues were more understandable in 2018 but not now. ""The panal has a gap of 5 mil"" ""No, it\'s made with a gap of 5mil with 3 microns of precision"" talking about a model y refresh already? to differentiate it more from the model 3 maybe? TBH, they are already there and its just our measuring devices that are wrong. /s Millimeters would be a good start. They don't even have it that far. Erm the entire industry measure in microns We heard this years ago.  Things got better but nowhere near what was claimed. 3.4 millimeters not great not terrible More precision does not mean more accuracy how big is a 1"" panel gap in microns? Technically an inch is 25,400 microns. Oh come on. Just improve the gaps and paint quality to normal standards. Improve wind and road noise while you're at it. You added expensive dual-paned glass that seems to have offered zero improvement.  No need to reinvent the wheel. My Y is fucking perfect. Is it really only sassy investors left on this sub? Whats up with comment section? Gotta get from centimeters to millimeters first though I literally cant believe anything he tweets anymore. Id be fine with millimeters if they were CONSISTENT Yeah the model x and s he was happy with inches. 10 microns most likely. I just hope the roof stays on. In regards to panel gaps? Those panel gaps about to be 8000 microns wide Sorry, out of the loop on what this is about, mind filling me in? .... manufacturing tolerances are not something you want to say you run that tight... Microns? A part of one of my 3's headlights is so close to the panel it's scrubbed the paint off. Microns, phaw! I have NEGATIVE microns! The new single piece castings's tolerance will be way better than the combined tolerance error of hundreds of stamped parts welded together.    I think what he means is that the tolerance will be less than 1mm- measurable in the micron range but no way it'll be single or double digit micron precision. Well he should start with milimeters lol Didn't he say something about your ruler being less accurate than the panel gaps at one point? Anyone else just start cringing when Elon tweets?  I used to be all about it but now I wish her stop promising shit he doesnt intend to deliver on. Let's just start with getting the panels to be not obviously misaligned. I aim at the stars - but sometimes I hit London. Why do other car companies entering the ev market so concerned about panel gaps or fit and finish. As long as things look good overall and dont rattle loose.   I am not a big car guy. And love my model 3 for its simplicity. I care more about the experience of driving.   I am not going to buy a Ford or Volvo ev because the door panel gap is a millimeter better.",1784,"3 months, 6 months defiantly I will only be satisfied once we have reached atomic level of accuracy.  Quantum level would be preferred! Extreme precision of what? Door panel gaps/vehicle length/ battery size. How about aiming to keep the stock from crashing How about instead we get lifetime watts/mile efficiency and total kW charged added to the odometer? A renter just reset my trip odometer that's been going since I got the car and it doesn't look like that info is tracked anywhere. Ngl I used to think he was a good guy that was just a bit weird, somewhere along the way my feelings changed.  Now I lose a bit of the respect I once had for him every time he opens his mouth.",2

It avoids the clumsiness of referring to both the ""ship"" and the full stack as ""Starship"". It also avoids the term  ""Super Heavy"" for something that in time might no longer be ""super"" heavy.  Perhaps we should use his terminology more on this sub? An observation after reading this thread: I think too many people are reading too much into Elon saying ""booster 2"" - after all, it IS the second booster to be constructed. Don\'t let the official numbering throw you off. BN2 is now a test tank (and it\'s in the mid bay right now):       it\'s also been said that it will be used with a thrust puck simulator. I wonder what SN16's fate will be. If the rumors about SN16 going to display are true it suggests that SpaceX wants to go directly orbital. If this is true, I think we have a good chance of seeing an orbital flight, and possibly recovery, this year. This booster only partially constructed? I seem to recall that it is supposed to be 20m taller than the craft. Is that booster fully stacked? Sorry but I'm a bit of a SpaceX noob.  Is this really the 16th Starship in his efforts to send us to Mars? Ok so they aren't going to unit test the booster all by itself first?  Also I wonder why they haven't been parallel testing boosters this whole time. It just blows my mind how SLS has taken so long to stack one, meanwhile SpaceX is just cranking these out and testing almost weekly   I wonder how different NASA would be today if not hamstrung constantly with politics   (Not knocking SLS btw, I am just as excited to it fly as an Orbital Class Starship) So smooth and shiny! Fit and finish miles away from MK1. Huh, I guess BN3 was renamed BN2. But why only do that with the booster? Sweet! My wife has something that looks like that!  Is there any photos of the heat shield pattern/layout? Awesome So when do we expect the next hop? Will it be another short hop, or are they going orbital this time? I thought the booster would be taller than Starship. Amazing Isn't the booster supposed to be taller than starship?    Is Booster 2 shorter than the expected final version?",681,I have a feeling starship development (and its setbacks) have taken a toll on the program as a whole. With one finally landed without exploding it may be that SpaceX  have decided to roll with it and throw something more conventional off a launch for the time being... I'm just amazed at the amount of vasaline he's apparently smeared on the lens of his iPhone. Full of doge coins,29

Fortunately, 15 is on display (minus raptors, of course) in the trailer park, so hopefully, for austerity purposes, it'll stay intact There\'s perfect logic to his naming convention.  There\'s an overall plan to the development that reaches a considerable time into the future.  Parts of the development are planned and earmarked for a specific S/N because that\'s when they expect to be ready for that upgrade.  If development accelerates for a particular major item, the intermediary S/Ns become obsolete, yet to just insert this into an existing planned S/N may not be feasible because other parts of the S/N are not ready for it and a future unit is ready.  This would cause potential errors as every intermediate S/N effectively has to be ""redesigned"" so it costs him less to simply skip a planned S/N and avoid potential production errors as many components on site have the intermediate S/Ns written on them and you have the chance of building a unit with the WRONG PARTS!!!  Just my humble opinion. I think the confusing point is the mixing of terminologies, referencing the 2nd article for the booster and the reference number for the starship Wait I was under that assumption that boosters were way bigger than Starship?

That is simply insane. Building an entire launch platform in a single year is crazy, but building one meant for the middle of the ocean cranks it up to 11. I can't wait to see a launch from it. That render looks sick. Hopefully the actual spaceports will looks somewhat like that what are the impacts on sea life? Alright.  We have launch pads at sea.  What's to prevent unfriendlies from coming close? I'm curious how crew will be handled on the ocean platform.  Will they be evacuated for each launch and landing?  Or will they have a reasonably secure location well below-decks of the rig, where a RUD-ing booster is unlikely to reach or cause destabilization of the platform? Interesting that he'd say that because as it is currently, Phobos is at least a month or more ahead of Deimos in stripping the old structure away, and iirc they won't even start on Deimos until they've deepened the berth that Deimos is situated at. Just interesting he'd mentioned Deimos over Phobos. Does sea launches mean it will be impossible for anyone to watch a launch in real life ? That would be a bummer to have no one being able to witness the first human launch to Mars. How will they transport the booster and starship from Boca Chica to the platform for launch? How tall will the rocket be when it launches? How will they keep a constant flow of fuel supply when they are that far offshore? Wait so theyre gonna launch an oil rig into orbit!? Thats gonna be an exciting one. /s If this doesnt look like something from Star Wars is it all really worth it...   Cant wait You are the human of future Deimos is under construction for launch next year.  Damn! We're gonna need a helluva lot of Raptors for that **!!!** u/SpaceXMirrorBot I wonder how regulatory environment changes with sea launch and recovery. Great news, been anticipating this news and Only a few know its importance This thread is the perfect example of why you should never trust comments here without sources. Dozens of people giving assumptions and guesses as replies to things like ""how far off shore will this be"" or ""why are they using offshore rigs?"" and then just like 2 people giving a quote from Elon with the actual answer for both of them. They actually gone launch that thing into space. Has it already been under construction??over the past few years or something or is it just getting started now?!?  Hard to believe something that size in the middle of the ocean could be built in just a year! Sea Dragon 2.0 next, I assume? Got these vibes of shot of Sea Dragon launch, but this is for real. How many rockets fit on the spaceport? Will there be one Starship per Spaceport or more? I don't think that its planned to move there ports in and out of a harbor like they do with the current ships. I wonder how stable these platforms are. The full starship stack is pretty tall and I don't think it'll like an unstable platform. I'm trying to figure out the stability considerations for this Deimos platform. First of all, the launch tower is much taller than the oil drilling tower that she was designed for, although it is possibly not heavier. Then a pretty heavy rocket is placed on the main deck, which also brings the center of gravity up higher still. Then, tons of propellent are rapidly transferred from tanks below the main deck to tanks a couple hundred feet higher in the rocket. Then suddenly that heavy weight goes instantly away. I'm not even going to think about the launch exhaust loads.  It seems like they will need a lot of new active and passive stability measures that are not needed for oil exploration and production. How difficult will it be to land on one of these? Would it be the same as their other ships? Silly question of logistics that I haven't seen discussed here yet:  1. Anyone have any idea on how they will get fuel to the platform? 2. Will they have the sabatier process going to generate methane or something?  LOX is easy enough to generate on site., but if they're shipping in methane, they're either gonna need a massive tanker located nearby for storing the majority of the methane, or they might establish a pipeline directly to the platform for easier fuel delivery. And depending on where they want to locate the platform, it wouldn't be able to be way out in the middle of nowhere or there might be fuel delivery delays. is this the future? And it is happening in one year! From casual googling, it looks like many oil rigs can be fixed to the bottom so that they are not really floating... could that be done with these, or are these ""float only"" kind of rigs?   It feels crazy to allow the big tower and rocket to wobble along with waves underneath... or can they load enough ballast on these things to make that not an issue? Cant wait for this, the future hopefully is a better than we have it right now! where are phobos and demios currently located at for the retrofit? Unexpected twist: Elon means that literally. During inauguration, the Deimos spaceport will be launched to orbit by several Sea Dragons hidden beneath. Will the riggs need the huge launch towers or is there any chance to partially submerge the stack like it was planed for Sea Dragon?  * I hope I can attend the launch party! Someone said an hour to get to the offshore launch platform.  Surely, we'd be talking helicopter, drone or fast hydrofoil transport (and, later, Hyperloops on the sea floor).  So to go 20 miles, surely far less...maybe 10-30 mins actual journey time. Re the names - Phobos and Deimos - is he having fun with his competitors (Boeing, Lockheed?) who were proposing that humans be launched to the Mars surface from the Mars Moons?  It is kind of rubbing it in that his mission architecture is the right one, by 100 million miles! I liked this report about the announcement:    They seemed very happy that the chosen name is Greek, and seemed to have not realized that it's named after the Martian moon (which has, of course, a Greek name). if possible they should store the propellants under water. I'm very excited and happy that the ocean spaceport project is moving so much closer to reality. But does anyone else find it mildly odd to name it after a moon that got *its* name from the god of dread and terror in Greek mythology?",1354,"Future is exiting! Hilarious.  His Flamethrower discussion on Joe Rogan. I bought an original Boring Company cap after that. He's the real deal. Deimos was the god of dread and terror in Greek mythology.   Interesting choice of name. I'm way past thinking that we're living an Ayn Rand novel where the USA collapses and the rich move to space. ...oh gosh golly, a highly advanced near sci-fi technological undertaking named after a greek god. That always goes so well, right? Especially if it\'s named after an ""evil"" god like Deimos, whose name means ""dread"". This can\'t possibly go wrong. I mean. come on... 2022? Can't see it. If a full-stack SS/SH launches from an ocean platform by 31st December 2022, I'll happily make hamburgers from my cats' turds and eat them in buns baked with their fur.  EDIT: Ok, maybe a bit too strong with the cats' turds comment... But really? Do you really think that timeline is gonna hold?

Im not hating but it really seems to be the case with a flat out cancellation of it What a weird, erratic company \u200d Ehh.. Rough. But at least Plaid is under 2 secs Right  Fuck needed that range Plaid+ was always about the new structural pack and cast ends. Either the new structural pack is behind, or they dont want to redesign the S with castings just yet. Sounds to me this is a result of overpromising. The only real difference between the two models was the range if we are being honest. Not saying its impossible but in order to get 500+ miles of range they definitely would of needed a bigger battery. Especially with the 3 motors making 1,000+ hp. They probably ran the numbers and the revenue/profit wasn't enough to justify the additional investment to build the plaid+ production.    I don't think people need to worry about roadster 2 as that's a halo car and not an incremental (or so we're told) improvement like the plaid+ is to the plaid. I would guess that they see the supply issues carrying into next year. Since Plaid+ is contingent on 4680, and 4680 is a novel cell that is contingent on SCALE, and scaling is contingent on a robust supply chain for raw materials, I would guess they cancelled Plaid+ so the cells they can make will go towards cybertruck and other new products. Kinda makes sense. Instead of having one variant of the S that is 4680 cells and body castings, just do that to the current variants.   Don't know what's gonna happen with the active spoiler that was spotted on the track. That was most likely going to be for Plaid+ but it's possible they make it an upgrade in the future instead. Did seem to me that plaid+ cannibalises the Roadster So does Plaid now have the same range as Plaid+? Because the increased range for plaid+ was the huge selling point. That's a lot of refunds What a joke. Love Tesla, but this was a failed over-promise. Unless the range from the Plaid+ carried over to the Plaid. We literally know nothing atm, so Im gonna hold speculation on this because we have just 4 days left for news. Only from Elon and Tesla can a product get canceled in a casual Sunday afternoon Tweet! I thought it was kind of lame, that their new awesome cells would premier in a lazy model s facelift. But now they will come with cybertruck maybe next year or 2023, which is also sad to hear.   But yeah pretty transparent, that they didnt overarchieve with plaid but instead are not ready yet with the cells. I mean they just cancelled their flagship, range king car. If they could make it, I think they would. In other words, they couldn't actually make it, they need the money now from plaid+ people, or both.   Well at least he's not going to keep pretending it's coming, unlike FSD *cough* So no more *Two weeks* This makes me so sad, I'm sick of Tesla cannibalizing their high-end cars, had to wait so long for a refresh and now we are stuck with 18650's, a cell format that is heavy, old,  and inefficient. Im curious if any other Plaid+ order holders received a call last week about switching order to Plaid. Maybe they didnt get enough bites? Stock price is gonna be a steal tomorrow. Man I got downvoted to shit for suggesting they were gonna cancel plaid+ when all those requests to convert plaid+ to plaid came out Can\'t wait for ""FSD cancelled, humans are just too good"" How is it ""just so good"" when it has 33% less range than a Model S Plaid+???  I think it is obv that they have huge problems with the mass production of thr 4680 cells. My take: they severely overestimated how close to mass production the new battery cells are and realized they wont see the light of day within the next year. What is with the Plaid+ customers? Will they get downgraded to the Plaid or do they need to make a new order (and take longer waiting time?).  Interestingly, if you order a Plaid on the US homepage you will get delivery in June. Suspicions... Honestly this is slightly concerning news yet unsurprising. Not sure how and why people are trying to spin it positively here. Seems like an obvious delay on 4680. Wish they would just be more transparent. Probably trying to drive Plaid sales.  Maybe too many takers waiting for Plaid+.  They Osborned themselves. Bullshit. Probably a battery issue with the new cells. Just trying to spin it. If 4680 is the issue, then I dont foresee CT tri motor coming anytime in the next 2-3 years Pretty sure Tesla employees just found out about this the way all of us did too. how do I get my $1000 back?  edit: it's actually easy on the website, I'm just sad about it. The 4680 being delayed is the only thing that makes sense. They are so far behind on their 4680 production timeline that the plaid + roadster, semi, cybertruck and new Y are going to be even further. Unfortunately if they said this their stock would take even more of a beating than it already has. Plaid+ was a direct reaction to the Lucid Air. Makes me wonder if Tesla just doesn't have the tech for a 500 mile range Cybertruck Canceled, Rivian, Ford Lightening in fact whole competition is too good. Woof. What a drag. Elon is batting one thousand lately.. My theory? Couldnt meet the 500 mile range nor sub 1.99 0-60.

I guess the web guy is waiting for confirmation The range announced during delivery will be 420 miles. Calling it. Translation: they actually can't figure out how to fit a larger pack into the S they are saving it for later possibly when the lucid hits production Tesla really should get some marketing people... So I had one of these on order in Australia. I could drop to the plaid. But is there any other car out there I can consider. I don't really want to spend 500k AUD. What kind of company take pre-orders for a product only to ""announce"" the cancellation in the reply to a tweet. Incredibly amateurish. Waiting to see what happens with the Plaid release event.  Seems odd theyd just concede the range crown to Lucid like that",1302,Roadster needs to be better than S. So plaid+ will be roadster system imho. I love how this sub always assumes the very worst with every single piece of news. Unbelievable. It means capabilities to continue engineering improvements may be impossible or marginal to a product that would have a very limited market.  Good! Maybe they can turn Tesla into a profitable business without green credits soon.,14

A month will be the new two weeks I hope they go over their actual driving policy AI. For years Karpathy has been talking about  image recognization, and while it is very impressive at this point, without proper driving intelligence, it will never drive good enough. Contrary to Elon's belief, driving is \\*not\\* just solving vision. &gt;Purpose is recruiting  Probably means no new info for a crowd (like us) who follows Tesla updates/progress closely  start lowering your expectations now. Give cybertruck day Don\'t want to read too much into this, but I think this was announced because we\'re still nowhere near ""The Button"" and Elon wants to distract and show ""progress"" to keep us all at bay. I have a theory than all these delays are due to brain drain. I know i would be trying to like hell to recruit Tesla talent if I was somebody like Ford. FSD is cancelled. No need, as Autopilot is just so good. V9 and button announcement date at that event... Beta 9.0 has been 2-3 weeks away for months. Without an actual set date for the event I'll just assume it will actually happen next year. If they don\'t release FSD by then, I think a lot of people will have had enough (and most customers have already had enough for a while). They\'re gonna talk about ""the progress of FSD"" and how hard it is to ""solve driving"" when people just want the beta. Release ""The Button"" and give people what they paid/want to justify paying for. Elonnnn!!!   This post is made with love, I don\'t mean to hate &lt;3 So six month definitely ? Cant wait for the prediction threads where literally nothing predicted comes to fruition Translation: The button isn't coming anytime soon and FSD is much harder than we thought, so we'll show our progress so far and hope people understand. Dojo super PC, ad. At this point I rather Elon tell the truth on FSD FSD will come the day after the event. With subscription. And robotaxi. Xmas Holiday release will be   Elon: turn over CEO reigns to Karpathy. You go focus on spacex and starlink and boring. Recruiting huh? That says a LOT right there. That means they\'re needing people to push FSD.  Plus I ain\'t believing any of this. A month or so out. What about the other things he has said that were a ""month or so out?"" Why do you need to recruit people for a problem thats practically solved?? Let me guess, robo taxis by 2019? Lmaaao Things I'm not expecting to hear at AI Day:  1) We've eliminated phantom braking on clear days with no other vehicles around   2) Cars on Autopilot will no longer cross the centerline of roads in a turn at town speeds.   3) The car will allow the driver to cross the centerline when they need to make space for pedestrians, bicyclists, or other obstructions in the side of the lane.  Sadly, drivers will no longer feel like they solved the Trolley Problem.     4) In a turn, if autopilot is given the choice of touching the sideview mirror to the centerline while there's oncoming traffic or simply hugging the empty shoulder, it will choose the shoulder.  Failing that, it will just stay in the middle of the lane. They need to recruit new ideas to finish FSD V11 coming late august? Recruiting the team to build version 9 LOL Pretty sure FSD Subscription won't come until then. FSD owners need a carrot. Roll out City Streets as Beta with the same or stronger precautions as AP, self park, summon etc. It wont be perfect but neither was AP. With a continuous improvement process, it'll get better over time and owners won't feel fleeced. It'll also buy time for the development team and actually help recruiting. How can they continue to sell FSD? Wheres the FTC or the governing agency responsible for this sorta stuff? Button is canceled    We have data that no one pressed it... AI was found to be using coal energy, so it would be banned from Tesla software :) If two weeks is infinite, what's a month? I would quit my tech job at a major automotive-related company to go work for Tesla.  Sign me up! Just get parallel teams working on the problem independently, and then pool together the knowledge after a couple of years. Vaporware One month maybe, two months definitely.

The director of AI at Tesla gave a presentation in the last couple days talking about their supercomputer capabilities (1.8 quintillion operations per second now with 10 petabytes of storage) and mentioned specifically at the end of that slide how they were looking for new team members to assist in the building of the next generation machine, Project Dojo. I would assume that they are going to talk about that and what new capabilities the processing power of the computer brings to their AI training of Autopilot using the vision and video approach, which is very different from all their competitors using Lidar and multiple sensors in fusion.

Fitting, however. It\'s namesake ""Experiencing A Significant Gravitas Shortfall"" is a GCU, e.g. Special Circumstances. Omg.  Looks like it is hauling ass!  And no tug hooked up!  WOW! Wondering feasiblity of all electric or hybrid power for these ships. In addition to sustainability its an image thing. I think the thing Im most impressed by is that they kept it out of sight until now. Shiny!!!  Can't wait to see the first scorch marks. Modified from what sort of vessel? Or purpose-built? Its been a while but certainly worth the wait! Looking forward to the dual dronseship landing later this year! I would love to see a helicopter view like CRS-8. Looks very different from the others. Anybody know anything about that? Oh wow it looks dope. Hope to see it in action soon They didn't have to make it look cool, but I'm glad they did  So... would I be crazy in thinking this new autonomous ship removed the need for a tug?   It seems to be moving at a pretty good clip for what it is, and in the circle maneuver by the drone I can't see land so it seems to be a fair ways off shore.   Definite cost savings there if that is the case. I wonder if the idea is too eventually just land the rocket, lock it down with the octograbber and sail this sucker home, no humans involved at all. Galactic Battleship! Been looking forward to seeing this baby for years and it did not disappoint Where is the roomba lair on this thing? Do we know  how long it took the OG Droneships to go into active service? Just need Hulk Hogan commanding it... Thunder in Paradise (would make a great name for the next droneship, crew dragon etc... :P) Looks like this ""droneship"" may finally actually be a ship. Do the others have starlink dishes?  I'm pretty sure there is one clearly visible in the last few seconds of the video.  *Edit - It looks like [OCISLY had one back in may]( ASOG looks smaller than JRTI and OCISLY. Or is that just an optical illusion from the different design? It looks awesome! This one looks a lot narrower than the other ships. Or fhe circles are just bigger. Anyone know the size differences? I always love the Culture references, though if Elon is any character from the books it's fucking Veppers. OK what is propelling this thing? Marmac 300s are 100 feet wide. Those six generators? marine engines? what? are taking up at least 65% of that deck space. Thats 65+ feet of propulsion componentry. This thing is obviously moving on its own, anyone know how? Looks awesome. Will there be a bigger  ASDS for Starship landings or will they use this one? Haven't been following super closely lately Is this a leased barge like the other ones or did SpaceX build this? Saw it as it set sail. Didnt recognize it at first, looked mean as hell. Co-workers and I joked around that it was some sort of stealth ship. If Neutron and Terran R end up happening, I wonder if there's a place for another firm to step up and build a freelance drone ship.  Provide services for LSPers that don't want to vertically integrate like this, and maybe even provide extra landing capacity for SpaceX if they need to spam payloads faster than the ships can get back to port. That close to an oil rig, decent. [Elon just confirmed on Twitter:]( Fully autonomous, no tug needed anymore! It's got that blade runner feel to it Wow! Same feeling I had the first time I saw Enterprise NCC-1701-D -- so familiar, yet awesome. How many of you noticed the two people at the back of the ship... Anyone know the upgrades/changes? Holy shit that's one hell of a wake it leaves behind I love that the name ""Shortfall of Gravitas"" serves as a reminder that Falcon 9 is small fry compared to BFR lol I hope when they start naming starships theyll give them Culture ship names as well The drone ship team got jealous of Cybertruck\'s lines and someone said ""we can do angular panels too."" &gt;Autonomous SpaceX droneship, A Shortfall of Gravitas  So, like a Mind,  version #0.00000000000001 ? This is what happens when you breed a [KITT]( and an [ASDS]( ASOG is moving under its own power, at a pretty good clip.  With a decent octograbber, it should be able to go out and retrieve a booster unassisted, bringing it back to port with no human intervention at sea, in some cases.  Do I really think they will send it out without a tugboat? Not for a couple of years, but after that, maybe.  \\---  It looks to me like it is doing at least 10 knots, maybe 12. I think that means it has at least 1000 horsepower available for propulsion.  Finally, it looked to me as if there were windows on the stern. If I was right about that, (and I am not at all sure) there may be a space for people to ride along as it goes out, or as it returns, Why would they do this? The whole idea of using a drone ship is that it is safer in the event of a crash, if no-one is aboard. So why? Maybe it has something to do with landing Starships.  SpaceX rarely builds something that just repeats the capabilities of the old model. Never repeats, actually. Every drone ship has had improvements. Every TE (Transporter-Erector) has had improvements. Every engine test stand has had improvements. Every launch complex has had improvements. Besides looking much cooler, I think ASOG was built to handle experimental Starship landings. Better quality. So what's going to be interesting from now is whether or not they'll refit the other two droneships to match ASOG. This will largely depend on the intended lifespan of Falcon 9 and any use that SpaceX may have for the droneships post Falcon 9 retirement.   If they do, they'll either:  * Find a gap in the launch cadence and either:    * Retrofit in one sweep.     * Progressively retrofit between launches.  * Create a fourth droneship to cover gaps.   I think it's logical to assume there is either a longer use case for these vehicles with Falcon 9, or a future purpose with Deimos/Phobos.   With that in mind, it's not unreasonable to consider if all are refitted and a fourth introduced, that each platform would have two drone ships to act as support ships. The fact they're autonomous and self propelled means the risk of having them nearby the platforms during launch is minimal. Could be used as back up communication vessels or even act as camera platforms during launch/landing operations. What version of Tesla autopilot is used? I mean wow it's looking very very good this drone ship.. is that 6 engines on it? Seems fast, although I've never noticed any of the other droneships moving at speed Is that oil rig in the background a hint about their new launch platform(s) or am I reading into the video too much? Hm, I thought those 2 white cones are Starlink terminals, they're actually satellite systems from [Intellian]( Bad ass, making the navy look obsolete Our friends at r/TheCulture aren't too happy about Musk naming a boat after a ship from The Culture: Anyone know what the full speed is on this Warrior? Anyone know what the full speed is on this Warrior? Does this mean it must carry more fuel, so it can move itself out to the LZ, and back? Hopefully those dual starlink pods will mean less video interruption! This needs some epic music. [edit]( This is amazing. It's due in port Thursday from Gavin Cornwell's latest tweet.  I wonder if the asymmetric top layout has any subtle advantage wrt risk of landing if the ship is oriented in a certain direction relative to incoming flight path of booster.  There is the obvious margin with bow/stern width, but now possibly a lowered collateral damage risk if the booster toppled toward the bow. Why isnt it electric? Guys, what do you think: is there any chance to get hired as a crew membr on this one? Will super heavy be able to do emergency landings on it or is that too heavy",1674,"Are they going to land on droneship, then lift onto offshore platform for relaunch?

That looks awesome!   looks like the Advanced Omega class destroyers from Babylon 5. Or the Blackbird from battlestar galactica. Very spiffy!! In comparison, the others look cobbled together like the engineering or design prototypes I suppose they were. This looks like fully mature design, not just a custom job but something that could be reproduced on demand  though is there a need for more of these if they transition to Starship? Me like Bitchin. Did SpaceX develop and build this ship internally or purchase? Seems like they could make some money here. I know that it happens on every Elon tweet, but I really wish he would lay off of the crypto currency bullsh*t!    Every single time he posts something on Twitter, the top comments are always about crypto.    Maybe this shouldn't bother me, but it does, especially when his Twitter post is related to SpaceX and has nothing to do with crypto. Very little gravitas indeed Not sure but the deck extending looks like it could fold in case they need to go through the Panama canal.  It also seems to be equipped with spud poles for mooring without ropes. HARDCORE My reaction as I\'m almost falling sleep in bed: ""Daaamn. Waaooooow. That thing is sick!""

Ah, she's built like a steakhouse but handles like a Bistro &gt;A Shortfall of Gravitas...  That doesn't seem like a very dignified name. Gotta lot love them Plate class GSVs. &amp;#x200B;  Is there such thing as a Stealth Landing Platform?  I know it's autonomous, however that said, I noticed there are still two inflatable life raft containers positioned over the aft thruster housings. I suppose it still has to meet the marine safety requirements for boarding after a landing, or for those  two guys having a chit chat over the noise of the diesel engines on the transom walkway. nice sizzling hot plate of gravitas  That looks like something Darth Vader would own if he had a surface ship. if darth vader was a drone ship.

This is the first Shortfall Of Gravitas (not including the sci-fi spaceship it was named after). It was announced way back in 2018 and only just finished. It was a different droneship, Just Read The Instructions that had two models with the same name.

This is engineering porn. It has a very soviet russia feel to the rocket warehousing. Thought that they were about 6ft high but then I saw the guy in the middle Theyre Huge!! Forest of Engines Still can't believe somehow that SpaceX intend to drop all these engines in the ocean after one flight. Surely ther must be some options for landing the booster which would potentially save 30+ engines. Reuse has always been SpaceX's creed and now the stakes are so much higher, given all the work they put into these engines. (Sorry noob question here) N21 seems to have been stripped off of a lot of parts. Design seems different to me as well (the big pipes have different angles), or maybe not...? Edit:remove unintended yelling and clarify it's a question What in the world is going on here, they've got Rators on their sides, Raptors in cages, Raptors with blinds over them, adolescent Raptors just all over the place... must be a very interesting place to tour It's the idea behind all this which leaves me gobsmacked. Elon intends to crank these out at a frankly insane pace. He intends to produce 3,000+ just for the Starship fleet, and another 30 for each booster.  I originally was gonna say 30,000+, but then I remembered the boosters will not be going to Mars. Even so, that's a lot of engines. If he gets the price down to $250,000 each, (I think that's his target) that's a billion dollars. My god, some of them are out of their cages! Clever girl.... ...and my v! Really looking forward to a picturebof the bottom of Superheavy with all the raptors installed. Its going to be insane seeing 29 engines firing together! That one in the cage likes to get out Next bottleneck. Where do we put all the raptors? They look like a bunch of female Daleks. I don't know what I was expecting, but there are way more pipes going around each engine than I expected. Looks a bunch of earbud cables that you can't get untangled. I know they make iterative changes when building the rockets, but shouldn't these Raptors all start to appear identical -- with all the pipes and wiring consistent, etc. ? Everytime I see engines like these, I\'m always reminded at how much a difference ""concept"" to ""practice"" is for things like this.   Like, the basic principle for a rocket, is very simple.   But there\'s so much going on here. Basically solving all the problems inherent to executing the basic principle. I know that Starship will ultimately have both sea level and vacuum rated raptors. But the RVacs are huuuge. It doesnt seem like theres a lot of extra space under Starship with the sea level engines installed in the previous tests, so will these RVacs protrude out from under the skirt? Will the skirt be lowered and then the sea level raptors mounted in a way so the bells are even? 2-4 raptors a day out of texas?   That's crazy.  A full stack every two weeks.   25 full stacks a year.   What do you even do with them all? Gonna need more than that, something like 31 for the new Super Heavy Booster.  They look about the same size as the Russian NK-33 used on their N-1 Booster for their Moon Mission.  It also had about 30 engines.  It was a cleaner look with much fewer pipes, not that that is better.  They aren't designed to be purty, and every part has a critical function and must earn its way onto the rocket by weight and benefit. Right one looks like a used one. Soot and it is fixed to pallet by straps. I expexted there to be nine. This maybe a stupid question &amp; it might just be my screen settings but does anyone know why the engine bells have a green hue to them. Is it do with the raptors specific metallurgy?

Or in other words: Just how good are Tesla's compared to other EVs? Yes. Tesla Model S Long Range Plus Tesla Model Y Performance Tesla Model 3 Performance Ford Mustang Mach-E 4X Porsche Taycan 4S PBP  I really hate that I can look at the list, and have to look up what 4S PBP and 4X. I remember reading this last week and I couldnt even figure it out. I just cant comprehend their naming scheme and trying to order either or build a quote, is just impossible. I didnt see 4X anywhere on Fords website.   I just wanted to know if were comparing Performance models to like the more efficient Taycan and Ford if theyre all using the less efficient but higher performance.   I dont knowI just hate when things are lot simple when they could easily get away with it. Theres not really a standard with how much you can customize I guess. Its just so confusing and its not like you can go to a dealer to help decode things for you. The supercharger network certainly had a big part of this. I'm very confused how the model y beat the model 3 though New Roadster should take number one if it really does have 620+ mi of range, it can probably skip a supercharging stop that the others have to make, and a huge pack like that should stay in the optimum charging rate longer. Well I mean, what did we expect right? =P Also note that the Tesla vehicles in this test were not new.. they are borrowed from existing owners and we dont know the mileage on them. But the stock will end -2% today because:  ""Chevy Bolts are being recalled due to fire risk, so Tesla must also be just as bad. or even worse, since they have bigger batteries"" -CNN, probably. I saw this, I just don't understand why they gave the Ford EV of the year.   But, I mean, it can't always be Tesla winning. Hmm, I guess when buying an EV one has to better understand the charging network efficiency. And that was with the Performance models of the Y and 3. Would like to have seen them use the LR versions of both, instead of the Performance models.  They would have been much closer to the S. For competition like this, you know Tesla will win even if you thinking without a brain. Race on Sunday They should run an electric canon ball, NY to LA. I suspect the tradeoff of speed/range to charge time will require cars to drive less than the speed limit for minimum time run, making it possible to do legally. And this was with the performance versions on the 3 and Y. Think about how much more they would have led with the LR versions - which are arguably the Tesla of choice for those doing roadtrips of this length. And then put the Mach-E on the cover of the issue...",294,"I always imagined something like this as a good marketing opportunity for put two families in a car for a road trip. One in a Model Y, one in a similar gas car.   Who can finish the road trip first?  People always complain about charging time, but I think on most road trips that combining the bio breaks with charging saves a significant amount of time over fueling a car and then needing to have a bio break separately. kind of odd to call it a race when they all took different routes. but i guess this is thread is for circlejerking?",25

Aw, FUCK YEAH! Dude.. that rocket is going to be a BEAST The question is, when will they SF the full compliment of raptors? Serious question: Why did SpaceX do a 3-engine static fire? What do they learn from that after doing 3-engine fires for every Starship prototype so far? As far as I know Booster 3 won't fly, right? So why not jump straight to a 9-engine test? Are they going to do additional static fires with more engines attached? I see a lot of talk about catch on landing. I was wondering if it wouldn't make more sense to try to catch the F9 boosters on a modified OCISLY? Removing the landing legs form the F9's would increase their performance, and testing on a much smaller more reliable vehicle would be easier. The roar felt around the world!  Wishing Mr. Bezos good luck today too It's been said that the starship's timetable got extremely fast and was very close to when the spacecraft was called ITS, but I believe that even for spacex, the pace has been too fast, for a spaceship designed from scratch, and I believe that this speed has a name, stainless steel, thanks to the insight of spacex engineers to find this new alloy, it was possible to build much more easily and much cheaper, to the point where many SN were built entirely just to be scrapped.    I remember that in 2018 spacex was still failing carbon fiber tank tests, now they already have a production line with highly disposable hardware made just for testing. It's really amazing how a single innovation changed everything. I loved how clean this burn was. It fired up, and then cleanly shut down. There was one final stream of flame and then very quiet again.     I'm looking forward to the day where they do a full duration static fire of a Superheavy. For some reason (I guess the size) this thing gets me more excited than the starship. I wonder the applicability of this test firing to future Super Heavies with 33 (?) engines.  If the plumbing will distribute propellant to groups of 3 engines in the final design, then this test may be important.  Proving that for one group, makes it more likely that 11 (?) systems will work similarly in parallel.  This seems important since propellant supply issues caused the 3rd flight failure of the Soviet N-1 Moon vehicle, putting a nail in the coffin of that program.  They think a water hammer from shutting down engines at the end of the boost phase was the culprit. Anyone have a link to the video of its static fire? I don't really feel like going through hours of livestream footage to find it (or hours of a video I just found that's titled booster static fire but I skipped around and couldn't find it)  EDIT: Nevermind there is video in the comments. Still sucks though because Twitter's video quality is horrendous. Why don't they put large thick steel plates on the ground to protect launch pad floor (instead of concrete)",1122,That's pretty static indeed Looking forward to an semi-orbital test in 2022!,17

Finaly we won t see anymore 'launch table constructiom continues' on nsf videos. Anyway i m really happy to see table being mounted as it is a very important part for starship to launch orbital. Now that table and tower are completed let s say that 2/3 are done, the third part being GSE tanks. But Enterprise could reach Warp 12. Engage Will they need to build one of these on Mars? It would be nice if Patrick Steward would kick off the count down sequence - in his Starfleet costume - with an Engage!   A great opportunity to get more public interest in space and in SpaceXs vision. Transwarp need ASAP.   We are the space x. Resistance is futile Elon to all SpaceX Personnel: Make it so.  Just when you think they can't go any faster, they turn it up to 11, Warp 9, and do the Kessel run in 12 parsecs... Must be fun working for Elon.... Let me know when they get to ludicrous speed. It's not inconceivable that a cargo starship loaded with goods to the hilt, could be put in orbit around Mars from this coming window, at this breakneck speed SpaceX has going. Just to put essential goods in orbit around Mars as storage when the landing base has been chosen and crews arrive from later Mars windows. They got to have a lot of stuff for that mission.  Second is, they are under contract, to put people on the Moon in a couple years with a demonstration before that around the Moon. To do this is going to require a lot of hustle and no fooling around. Attempts and RUDs and all, need to be corrected to be successes.  Warp 9 is necessary. It may have to stay there. He should've titled it 'installing the stargate'.  They have been moving extremely quick this last week, this picture does not do it justice at all. Fuck ... he wasn't kidding.",720,"Warp factor? And let me say : May the force be with you. IF they go past Warp 9 they go back in time.  Also, ballsy move using two cranes to lift and pivot.  Hats off to the steely eyed missile men and women of SpaceX. That's one heck of an orbital support hoola hoop! I'm excited to see all the MVacs get installed onto Starship, and boy will it be amazing to get all the installation and prep work done by the end of August. Just the fact that there's only been one Booster serial so far for that initial build, now SN20 + BN3? stacking for an orbital launch attempt really shows this speedup attempt On which scale though? The TOS scale is X\\^ 3. The TNG formula is (for lower warp speeds at least) X\\^10/3.  So warp 9 is 729 vs 1516 times c, depending on the scale used. There is a whole factor of Elon Time difference between those values! I hope we will make it during this brief window of opportunity, we must reach out into space and increase our scope and survival, everyone needs to be moving with a sense of urgency for humanity rolls the dice every day, at least Space X gets that, the others seem to be acting as though everything is going to be this good forever, it wont be if we stay on Earth and don't expand quickly. It's more like a Stargate no? Is this something where rho, beta, gamma and kappa tokens will  take part of?",2

I was worried Elon may have broadcasted the injector plates to the whole world, but obviously they're covered as most of the workers there don't have a clearance(?) The most powerful rocket stage in human history is now on the launch pad. 5 of the RB nozzle seem to be clean. Does that mean they have never been fired before ?  If so that mean they are very confident with the design and the fact that a static fire is a good enough of a test. Oh my. I can't wait for this, it seems unreal. What an insane angle to see Does anyone have an idea about the interior structure of the OLT seen in the third pic?  I am talking about the ""arms"" that seem to have a pivot at the lower end.

The next version after this prototype will be more efficient right? Thats what she said - too easy. Amazing to see these massive components come together. I feel extremely fortunate to be alive and witness this generation of space exploration Anybody have an idea of what those wires are that seem to be daisy chained between each motor? Never again will I question the amount of engines I try to squeeze on boosters in KSP. So did spacex ever get approval for their tower? because it seems like they are about to launch a rocket off of it... Whens the ETA on this bad boy hitting the skys? These past few days of SpaceX news have felt like a stretched out version of that Michael Scott scene when he said IT'S HAPPENING; EVERYBODY STAY CALM! cant wait to see that booster landing. About 30 raptors - insane  How exactly is the booster sitting on the table? I really can't figure out what points of the hull are bearing the load, and which points of the table are against it.     I'd love for one of the talented modellers here to put something together and show it. Gonna squeeze 4 more engines in there in the future too. Now THAT is a crap ton of engines. Can't wait to see 'em all light! And I thought the N1 looked crazy. Wow.  Going to be a thing of awe and beauty if this gets off the ground with every engine successfully lighting. We'll worry about getting back on the ground later. Is this booster ultimately going to fall into the ocean? I use those exact same 2 ton yellow come alongs at work. Fuuuuuuuuuck this is why I love Space X, seeing them use stuff that I use every day just makes it so relatable. They're tying down a 230 foot rocket with god damn come alongs They are going to add metal around the outer ring of engines after they set the booster on the orbital launch mount, right? Will they put Titanium partitions between the engines in the outer ring?  Will they put an inner ring of metal between the outer ring and the inner group of 9 engines?  Working on the shuttle main engines was very labor intensive because there was not enough space to do the work properly. Adding aerodynamic covers after installation makes a lot of sense.  I don't think these engines could survive reentry unless there are aerodynamic covers around them. What a magnificent piece of equipment.  It's kind of sad that chances are pretty good that it's going to end up as shrapnel.  I mean, I'd be thrilled if it didn't, but we all know that's not how SpaceX works.  Build awesome things and blow them up until they don't.  Godspeed, superheavy! Looks like 4 untested RB's (completely white throats). I don't think these engines are all wired in, but are attached for fit checks at this point. Given the height of the booster on the orbital mount and the precise nature of stacking the upper stage.. how the hell are workers going to ensure the second stage is locked in? There is otherwise no other way to access that area   And I think the man lifts are just about maxed out Are there going to be special procedures for those who live in Boca Chica? 29 engines is going to be far louder than 3. Engineer:  How many engines do you want on the rocket?  Elon:  Yes. I literally said this to myself before. Were watching a prototype of the most powerful rocket in existence with 2x the power of the Saturn V and being 100% reusable.  Its amazing we get to see SpaceX iterate and innovative everywhere. Are those outer ring raptors going to have some sort of fairing covering all that plumbing and wiring? Seems kind of fragile for something directly exposed to max dynamic pressure. Ok, Low-value-comment warning.  I WILL NOT be missing the launch of that beast when it happens, come hell or high water. Five of those bells look like they just rolled off the production line. Did they stop testing every engine? No shrouding on engines at all? Maybe a stupid question but what does the rocket stand on? On the 3. image I only see the raptors but no standing legs. Cm'on Elon u can do it This is fucking awesome. We've been following this for so long that it's hard to believe it's actually happening  and yet they've done it in so little time. And I can't help but think it looks straight outta KSP with those engine bells sticking out. I know it's probably gonna blow up on the bad or at Max-Q ( sincerely hoping it doesn't), but it's still a tremendous achievement to have gotten this far... and they've gonna keep trying till it works anyway. Go SpaceX &lt;3 Will they implement water based sound suppression system for the launch table? A few of the bells look clean, they weren't test fired?   Also, props to that amazing crane, what would they do without it Can they even test anything there? Very excited to see the show Anyone have any idea on when the first static fire of this baby will be?  Wonder if the launch pad will take it, I'm sure they have calculated it, but it looks so small - and no flame trench. Are going to mount starship SN20 on top of this booster and are they both going to fly at the same time? incredible...on multiple fronts.. though, with this gigantic engine block the grid fins look tiny in comparison..apparently its possible to control descent with the fins, but if you look at it I just wonder ""but how?"" Those outside Raptors have plumbing / wiring that is out past the body of SuperHeavy, kinda feel like they might get damaged by the airflow as this thing gets going.   Im sure SpaceX did their homework on it, but sure looks like those should be shielded to me. A few days earlier, SpaceX had installed an eighth service segment for the orbital launch complex, dubbed Mechazilla. It is necessary to bring the entire 120-meter system (Super Heavy + Starship) together. Its amazing to see the pace of this! NASA would have taken a week to make this lift. That third photo is bonkers. I don\'t know if this is the right place to ask about this. Is it OK for workers to ""push"" on Raptor engine plumbing like I saw them doing on a [NasaSpaceFlight video]( The plumbing looks ""thin"" by it seems these ""small"" tubes are VERY tough  Some cheap screen shots from the video; around 8:30 Anyone else getting extreme N1 vibes from all those engines? Hopefully with much bertter engineering! Amazing Very cool shots Holy forking shirt. Does the booster need to be pressurized for them to stack starship on it? Kind of like a pallet of soda cans Amazing Every time I see a starship picture I get turned on, I know, its a problem.....but its so COOL! They finally wrapped the raptor engines as predicted.

Though this a pretty big deal for SpaceX, and has some negative repercussions for most smallest launchers, it is important to note that this is NOT an EXCLUSIVE agreement.  &gt; Moving forward, we will continue to operate with a variety of launch providers to ensure that launch needs can still be met in the event of unavailabilities of specific providers. Am quite sure that by 2023 falcon 9 will be rendered obsolete by starship Starship will cost less than 5 million per launch while falcon 9 will still be over 40 million  It's simple math I swear Planet also made a deal with astra not long ago... Well I hope the small sat launcher pick up their pace to compete with SpaceX! (Otherwise they might not survive ) Really? SpaceX gets another contract with any other company? That's so unfair, think of the other billionaires with rocket launch companies! /s Earth has become self-aware, time to run before she gets revenge. Which planet, though? Which planet? signing with SpaceX has the added benefit of funding the cool stuff going on in Boca Chica. ;-p Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, contractions, and other phrases which expand to something larger, that I\'ve seen in this thread:  |Fewer Letters|More Letters| |-------|---------|---| |BFR|Big Falcon Rocket (2018 rebiggened edition)| | |Yes, the F stands for something else; no, you\'re not the first to notice| |[GEO](/r/SpaceX/comments/oyhciz/stub/h7tpr7s ""Last usage"")|Geostationary Earth Orbit (35786km)| |[HLS](/r/SpaceX/comments/oyhciz/stub/h7txfmd ""Last usage"")|[Human Landing System](#Human_Landing_System) (Artemis)| |[LEO](/r/SpaceX/comments/oyhciz/stub/h7u0r0a ""Last usage"")|Low Earth Orbit (180-2000km)| | |Law Enforcement Officer (most often mentioned during transport operations)| |[LOX](/r/SpaceX/comments/oyhciz/stub/h816xzz ""Last usage"")|Liquid Oxygen| |[RP-1](/r/SpaceX/comments/oyhciz/stub/h7ud6uh ""Last usage"")|Rocket Propellant 1 (enhanced kerosene)| |[SSH](/r/SpaceX/comments/oyhciz/stub/h816xzz ""Last usage"")|Starship + SuperHeavy (see BFR)| |[SSO](/r/SpaceX/comments/oyhciz/stub/h7u0p2v ""Last usage"")|Sun-Synchronous Orbit|  |Jargon|Definition| |-------|---------|---| |[Starlink](/r/SpaceX/comments/oyhciz/stub/h7xgkus ""Last usage"")|SpaceX\'s world-wide satellite broadband constellation| |[cryogenic](/r/SpaceX/comments/oyhciz/stub/h869uhe ""Last usage"")|Very low temperature fluid; materials that would be gaseous at room temperature/pressure| | |(In re: rocket fuel) Often synonymous with hydrolox| |hydrolox|Portmanteau: liquid hydrogen fuel, liquid oxygen oxidizer|  ---------------- ^(*Decronym is a community product of r/SpaceX, implemented* )[*^by ^request*](   ^(9 acronyms in this thread; )[^(the most compressed thread commented on today)](/r/SpaceX/comments/op7cqr)^( has 139 acronyms.)   ^([Thread #7183 for this sub, first seen 5th Aug 2021, 17:51])  ^[[FAQ]]( [^([Full list])]( [^[Contact]]( [^([Source code])]( offtopic  What a great and unique brand name.

The vehicle would have to expend more fuel decelerating after stage separation, then return to Earth.  Also, the final ""stage"" Starship would have to expend much more energy slowing down in Martian atmosphere due to a much larger mass.  Add the thin atmosphere, and that really doesn\'t seem to be a benefit To your edit, I don\'t think it would ""speed up"" the trip as much as it would ""allow you to leave later"".  Due to the orbits having different radii, you really have a set window, and while a faster insert could potentially expand that window, I\'m not sold on it being beneficial &gt; The answer: Drop tanks or more specifically drop-Starships.  *For every problem there is a solution which is simple, elegant, and completely wrong  H. L. Mencken*  The IDA is not designed to handle loads, and it\'s only intended to handle the torque of a small vessel docked with the ISS. This ""drop tank"" solution doesn\'t address the other end of the trip either: the cargo capacity of Starship alters the aerodynamic design and the landing propellant requirements.  If we look back to your requirements, you\'ve decided that Starships sitting idle on Mars are there unnecessarily, and that they would be better utilised back at Earth. Then your solution is to increase the cargo carried by each Starship before it sits idle on Mars.  I think in the first instance any Starships that are sent to Mars during the construction of the first propellant plant will be necessary for habitation: living space, air conditioning, power, and storage for propellant reserves. Some of them might even end up broken down for spare parts or scrap metal. Every gram of stainless steel will be useful, especially if the first wave of craft includes cutting and welding equipment. Recycling is going to be an essential part of the sustainability of a city on Mars.  Rather than doubling the cargo capacity of an individual Starship, doubling then utility of the cargo each Starship carries is worth looking at. Some Starships will be carrying about 100t of stainless steel to Mars along with all the cargo packed inside the cargo bay, others will be providing Starship-sized propellant storage tanks. They definitely aren\'t going to be ""idle"" and ""unnecessary"". &gt; It goes hand and hand with the idea that each Starship needs to be best utilized.  I think the opposite conclusion is true. The investment in efficient production means each individual unit is much less expensive, and therefore does not need to be perfectly optimized. If successful, starship will make reasonable the exact scenario you are trying to solve without bankrupting the organizations backing it. Break from the paradigm of optimization of everything sent to space, leave 20 supply starships on Mars for the cost of one conventional mission, etc. How about using Mars based starships to rendezvous with an Aldrin semi cycler, exchanging fuel needed to accelerate the cycler back into its transfer orbit for the cargo destined for Mars. The starships would remain on Mars and act as taxis between the cycler and Mars Wow I must be dumb. I didn't get that as much as i am trying to understand this, I interested in this A fully fueled Starship departing from a highly elliptical earth orbit is capable of landing much more than it can launch to LEO, at least on paper. So, you could transfer cargo in LEO or land with surplus fuel fur return flights, assuming the ship could handle the extra mass at Mars entry. There's no need. As is Starship can already land 300tons+ on Mars with in orbit transfer. With 1200tons and 100 dry cargo(220 dry mass including ship), it has 6.9km/s of delta v. You'd only need 3.8 of delta V to get to mars and land using low energy/longer windows. It might take a whole year though to get get to mars depend on when you launch it.  &amp;#x200B;  Musk said so himself that he'd use high energy/low travel for human travel for 6 months trip and use low energy ones for cargo during his ITS presentation.  &amp;#x200B;  This is the math for delta V calculation. With 400 tons and there's still big margin left. The problem would be that you'd run out of volume to put stuff in.  [  &amp;#x200B;  1200(fuel) + 400(cargo) + 120(dry ship) = 1720 tons The problem is that ""drop tanks"" can not return to Earth after boosting Mars ships. The dV cost could be insanely high for this maneuver and even return time might be several month making the entire idea dud.     Still - you could, probably, do aerobraking of empty drop ships and have them end up in Mars orbit to be used for fuel storage, expensive com sats or something. On a theoretical level, the simplest way to increase the ultimate load towards Mars is to raise the orbit ... in fact, most of the energy needed to reach Mars is to overcome the Earth's gravitational well ... from the Gateway to Mars there are about 1 km / s        In other words, if instead of starting from LEO you start from the Gateway (or another orbit near the edge of the Earth's gravitation well) the payload triples ... then it remains to be seen if and how you manage to land, but that's another matter Starship has a yet unknown upper limit on how much cargo it can aerobrake and land on Mars.   It\'s a physics problem. More cargo is more kinetic energy you need to scrub off at Mars. The ship is denser, and the weight balance is changed. You also need more landing fuel, which means larger header / low boiloff tanks, and thus more weight again.   Cargo Starship is not really delta-v restricted for most transfer windows, presuming you go with a efficient but 6+ month transfer. With a full load of fuel, a cargo ship could reasonable leave LEO for Mars with up to 300 tons of cargo without any extra boost needed. Could it land 300 tons of cargo? We don\'t know, but I suspect not without major improvements and changes.   Your concept of a Starship tug can be done with refuelling, and has been discussed here quite a lot and mentioned by Elon. Fuel up your cargo ship, and a tanker. Both burn a bit under half their fuel into a higher energy orbit. They dock, transfer fuel until the cargo ship is full. The tanker returns to Earth or LEO via a short burn and aerobraking. The cargo ship now has a full fuel load, just as if it had been pushed there by a tug. You have to \'dock\' the ships once either way. It\'s potentially slightly more efficient using two ships because you have more thrust to better take advantage of the oberth effect - but only for some missions. No changes have to be made to any of the ships.  Fast travel times are also an issue, as kinetic energy varies with velocity squared, so scrubbing off the extra speed is potentially very challenging. Again, maybe in the future as they collect more data, try aerocapture etc. We just don\'t know yet.  Having a high orbit fuel depot is one way to gain more delta-v. Solar Electric Propulsion seems like a decent prospect for a fuel tug in the significantly further future. Imagine a fleet of very scaled up Starlink satellites that constantly haul Metholox up the gravity well, and departing Starships stop in to get topped off.   I think optimising for the cargo to Mars (and the Moon) problem goes the other way. Build more cargo ships, and don\'t bring them back. Only bring back passenger ships. Scaling up and improving the production line is hard, but it has so many flow on benefits.  Elon has said before there is nothing on Mars that is worthwhile economically to bring back to Earth. That includes once used cargo Starships. You bring back (some) people, and scientific samples, because they are somewhat outside the scope of the economics. The only other reason to bring back cargo Starships is if you have a production bottleneck on Earth, and your supply is limited. So you effectively ""buy"" cargo ships by returning them from Mars - the cost being building, maintaining and running a multi megawatt Mars fuel production factory and rocket launch complex.   What\'s likely to be cheaper / easier / faster? Improving mass production on Earth, or improving fuel production and launch capabilities on Mars? I\'d bet on Earth.",43,"IMHO ... Mars won\'t support life, so we will mostly live in orbit above it and send short-term work parties to the surface to get the necessary in-situ resources.  We have no evidence to support the premise that people can gestate and reach maturity in fractional gravity.  Without reproductively healthy offspring, a surface colony is a dead end.  But Mars\'s gravity well is so much shallower than Earth\'s, so it can make sense to put big ""wheel in the sky"" habitats on orbit and use those as home base between intermediate length work tours on the surface.",4

SpaceX should keep focusing on space semi-trucks, let others handle the go carts. SpaceX already has plans for orbital tourism with Crew Dragon on a Falcon 9.  Sub-orbital just seems like a step backwards. I believe the future of space tourism is orbital, not suborbital. I think once starship is up and running we will see weekends in space that are competitive with current suborbital offerings. Maybe not the same price, but cheap enough that most people will go for the upsell. I think the main cost savings of suborbital flight is a cheaper rocket, so using an orbital rocket defeats the purpose. Not suggesting it is a good (or bad idea), but here is some rough maths!  **TL;DR. Booster + Dragon launched vertical = 240km altitude, 5.5 minutes of time in freefall. $160k propellant cost.**  (There was a [Starship version of this question]( where I did similar calcs last year. Much more viable perhaps.)  Let's do a New Shepard style flight with Falcon 9. But IMO more fun to leave the capsule attached to the booster the entire time. That sonic boom during landing would be great! Perhaps less safe but then you do still have Super Draco abort. Parachuting down would be interesting, but then you need to recover and stack the capsule again. Dragon propulsive landing would be even more fun!   * Assume a Dragon or similar capsule, mounted directly to the Falcon 9 first stage.   * 25 tons Booster dry mass.  * Assume 293 average engine ISP  * Assume 10 tons Capsule + people / interstage / trunk / extra cuploa / barf bags etc weight.   * Assume 5 tons propellant leftover.  * Total dry mass = 40 tons. Propellant = 395 tons. DV = ~6700 m/s  Our booster + Dragon has about 6,700 m/s dv, but let's work from 6000 to give some wiggle room for various extra losses or need to throttle back at certain times.   Let's assume we launch vertical at an average of 2G as felt by the passengers. Launch TWR is 1.75, so it will be slightly under 2G at launch, and slightly over 2G at engine cut off. We burn a bit under half our propellant, then coast up, then fall back vertically. The booster ignites engines and does a fully powered entry and landing - the reverse of take off. The forces felt up and down are the pretty much the same, and gentler on the booster than a normal flight.   The launch burn lasts around 153 seconds and engine cut-off is at 115 km altitude. The rocket is then doing about 1500 m/s vertically, and coasts for another 166 seconds, and 125km, for a total height of 240 km. Spin the whole thing to point at the Earth while coasting, and open up the cover on the Cupola for best views.   Then the reverse occurs for landing - fall back to 115km altitude, ignite engines, and decelerate at an average of 2g as felt by the passengers. Total flight time is about 10.5 minutes. Around 5.5 minutes of that is in freefall, for shenanigans.   How much would it cost? Hard to know. The booster is not very stressed by this flight, so refurb might be minimal. Propellant is supposedly about $200k for Falcon 9, but the booster uses about $160k of that.   Propellant cost + operational cost + refurb cost... Assuming 7 passengers in Dragon, then propellant alone is $22k. ~~$100k per passenger seems doable.~~ On further consideration, $100k each ($700k total) is unlikely without huge optimisations and possibly changes. Key unknown to me (more info a reply below) is exact refurb needed for engine coking.   Maybe you could squeeze extra passengers in since Dragon can take loads of cargo. Some systems could be removed too. 10 people? Or should you take 5 and charge twice as much? Launch forces are low, so maybe you can have a huge cupola with a fold back cover. Charge two people extra to view from there?  **Other options -**  * Partially fuel up the Falcon 9 Booster. 130 tons of fuel ($50k cost) is enough delta-v to just get you over 100km altitude. But where is the fun in that?  * 2G (as felt by the passengers) is an easy ride. The thrill seekers version could do 3g or 4g. At 4g your gravity losses are much reduced. Engine cut-off is 86km and you coast to a massive 366km altitude. And you get a bit over 8 minutes of zero-g!   * Weight reduction / lower margins means longer zero-g time. These numbers are perhaps quite conservative.   * Aerobraking during re-entry. Instead of burning all the way down, we can shed some velocity by 'flying', as the booster does normally. That leaves extra propellant for the up part of the journey, so extra zero-g time and altitude.   * [Use Starship instead.]( More room to move, more passengers, lower costs. Cons, it is not finished yet ;)  * What if we put a giant Dragon on Super Heavy? Or launch the full Starship stack vertically (1000km altitude!)? Or don't launch as high, and use spare fuel to hover at the highest altitude? Or drop at varying levels of thrust to simulate different planet's gravities? [The possibilities are fun!]( There is no suborbital market, at least not one big enough to keep VG or BO alive as a sole revenue source.   And why would SpaceX compete in suborbital when it can easily build a 200+ passenger ORBITAL Starship with a launch cost lower than the F9, offering ticket prices lower than VG/BO for a day in orbit, not a 90 second thrill ride.  Suborbital is the past. SpaceX always focuses on the future. It won't happen spacex have no interest in this. Spacex is going to be Boeing or Airbus of space rockets. In 20 years from now. Your normal airline like PanAm will offer you flight to Sydney on 727 in half a day or sub orbital flight on spacex rocket for triple the price in fraction of the time. There is better margin selling rockets to airlines for 400 milion a piece all over the world rather than selling individual tickets to tourist for couple grand each.",43,,0

Aside from the direct loss of an orbiter, inspecting and replacing those tiles really impacted Shuttle's turn-around time.  I also know that specifically the Shuttle lost a lot of tiles from the orange insulation flaking off the main tank and falling on it during lift-off. Obviously Starship isn't going to face that problem. I don't know if they had significant losses from other causes that might affect Starship.  Bottom line, they need to figure out how to not need this, and they wouldn't be going down this path if they weren't pretty confident they could. Starship is steel, TPS leaks are not nearly as big of an issue like Columbia. STS-27 had much more extensive TPS damage but made it back because there was a steel antenna underneath the area.  The reason they need TPS is due to the total heat load. The tiles on starship are gonna be much more robust than those on the shuttle. Im no materials science expert but the tiles on Starship arent *just* adhered theyre fitted onto a pin to hold them in place better. Plus theres no threat of falling debris to knock them loose I don't think it is necessary for a drone in space checking starship b4 reentry, but it would be super cool, it wouldn't need hardly any thrust..

We only have so much, so sending it out to schools would likely be a waste of the resource.  There's nothing really special about the stuff, it's just rocks and sharp dust, so I don't know why the government would have any control over it if they didn't collect it themselves. I wouldn't let kids play with the regolith, but showing them moon rocks would be pretty dope. You might missunderstand the Apollo samples.  They were kept under strict control because of their scientific value. They were VERY expensive to get and a limited resource.   If spaceX goes and picks up some moon rocks and brings them back on their own dime, they can do whatever they want with them. However, if the US government pays them to get moon rocks, they have to do what Uncle Sam says - which is for the good of the country. Its far better to give the few precious rocks to labs around the world than to let them sit in a drawer at an elementary school. Difference of bringing back kilograms vs tons. Including Starbase will just be a signature or two For anyone curious about how strict and careful NASA are about moon rocks, watch this excellent video:    As for SpaceX returning rocks and distributing them to 'middle and high schools across the world' ... no. They'll go to laboratories and research centres ... not some dusty draw for kids to dribble and snot over.  Besides the cost of returning rocks needs to be recuperated, so they'll likely sell them. Government could 'hold' them if they present a safety issue.  Theoretically it could be held for customs, as 'foreign material is being imported into the USA'.  However it would remain property of whoever imported it, and would have to be returned in a reasonable time period.    However, in general, anything brought back on a mission is property of the person who picked it up, however that would by contract probably go to their mission agency.  IE NASA astronaut signs a contract that anything they bring back belongs to NASA, SpaceX astronaut signs a contract that anything they bring back belongs to SpaceX.    SpaceX might not require such a contract though (or might not enforce it as heavily as NASA).  NASA has always had a very 'controlled' culture- mission planners know EVERYTHING that goes up and comes down.  Cost was a major factor of that- during Apollo a single KG to the moon or back cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Each moon rock was worth millions.  So if the astronauts came back with a few extra KG of 'souvenirs', that's basically NASA paying $millions for a few astronauts to get desk ornaments, which wasn't seen as a good use of resources.    SpaceX will likely be different though.  Much lower cost per KG there and back.  And much more likely to be easily repeated, especially if the same ship can be used multiple times.  SpaceX could, theoretically, do a Starship-to-Moon-and-back mission, and fly it 3 or 4 times a year.  For something like that, they'd probably start taking tourists and let them carry whatever they wanted back.",41,,0

Wow read his follow up tweet.  Looks promising that Beta 10.1, about 2 weeks later, will be good enough for public opt in request button  So basically theyre slightly expanding the beta and you have to request it. Shame I have two road-trips coming up that both fit within the next 30 days. I was thinking about subscribing and seeing if FSD is any better than it was a year ago when I had my Model 3 with FSD. I might get lucky and get to try FSD beta if Musk is right. Obviously I have my doubts though. It's a trap So the thing that we thought was going to be coming out _this_ Friday will not go out until _next_ Friday  Checks. Are there any Canadian FSD testers? I didn't buy FSD with the hopes that features would trickle down to AP. Now I'm sorta bummed I didn't get it. Crying in Canada Week delay, but still a week ahead of schedule. Moderately optimistic about this one. I have a new model 3 for pickup in November.  If the button comes out before that I'm going to seriously consider just keeping my current one with FSD.  Or maybe I can milk it for a extra couple grand with FSD beta released. I'll give him this: he's at least more committed to the bit this time, than in the past. Previously he would mention something like this, then totally ignore the self imposed deadline. At least this time, he's referring to it again.   Meanwhile, I'm still on the hook for $20, it appears: If FSD beta can be requested by the general public who are on a$199 subscription, that would be the way to go for most. That is 50 months of FSD subscriptions and 2-3 Teslas for those interested in CyberTruck and Roadster.  * The real question is will Tesla let you subscribe and still request FSD beta explicitly?  * Will FSD subscription come down or go up in price with volume? * Will Tesla be out of beta anytime soon after public rollout?  Smart move could be investing the $10K and pay for subscription on an as need basis.   Hope Tesla pull this off big time this year. Prefect timing, they deliver our model 3 LR that Friday :) So maybe public rollout on 24th? I\'m kind of tired hearing about all the FSD beta roll outs.  I care way more when it\'s going to roll out to me.    I\'m not going to watch anymore videos of people doing the ""Look what I have that you helped pay for.""  Bracing for the down votes.  :)  Please don\'t make it too painful. good news Ready for the ""FSD Beta 10 is an order of magnitude better"" with a ""FSD 10 is not that great tbh"" a few weeks later before 11 Are they still using radar or is it vision only? So late December / early January. Got it. Here I am stuck on 2021.3.106... Advanced updates enabled.",474,"Ya, to who though?

Is Nurburgring a legit metric used in the industry? Wouldnt the time depend on how good is the driver equally, or even more that a car itself? Nurburgring is the sound that my scooter makes when i start it in the morning. Holy SHNITT James May will not be impressed To be clear is this record for just electric production cars? That thing got a Hemi???? While I am impressed, this goes to show that the taycan is likely still faster in the corners, the nurburgring has many many straights and with how fast the plaid is, obviously it will be faster than the taycan, but only by a few seconds apparently, I'm not hating on Tesla or anything, it's a much faster car but the taycan is a Porsche and well Porsche knows how to make a car turn. Still extremely impressive especially for the price. Good thing Richard Hammond wasnt driving it. Bezos with a lawsuit ... anytime now. Porche probably doesn't like to be Plaid around like that I saw the video. The car is fast but handles like a dog - it's not suited for the track at all!

Now to beat the record for all vehicles... Now that's impressive!! For comparisons. What was the previous time that it broke? Time is 7:30:909. */ 7:35:579 Finally. How long have they been going for this? At least 2 years. Werent they clocking the prototypes last year around 7:10-7:20? Impressive times for sure but plenty of fast cars nowadays get under 7minutes. Its not the fastest four door vehicle either (though its pretty close).  Those who really care about Nurburgring times wont be blown away by this and the other 99% of people dont really care either way. The roadster will need to do a hell of a lot better to take the ICE crown. Was this with the 163mph limiter removed? Because that would yield a significant improvement on The Ring. Elon Musk - how many other production electric cars has run Nurburgring? 7:30 is great. But seems like my [original prediction]( ) from 2 years ago was ~~a bit too optimistic~~ actually right!  **Edit** holy shit as /u/PessimiStick has pointed out, I was actually *spot on* in my prediction lmao.  Comparing it to other sports sedans, its 5 seconds faster than the BMW M5 Competition, matches the 7:29 from Porsche Panamera Turbo, matches the 7:29 from the new [M5 CS]( and only 5 seconds behind the sedan record holder of Mercedes AMG GT-4.  At the end of the day, 5s on the Nurburgring can easily be gained by upgrading from the Pilot Sport 4S tires to Cup 2 tires, especially for a heavy car like the Plaid. Not sure what the Mercedes or other ICE cars was running on, but these cars are all within margins of error of each others now.  This number both shows how quickly EVs are progressing, and the challenge EVs have in motorsport. Despite being able to beat supercars on the drag strip, it's still only competitive against top tier ICE sports sedans on the Ring, and is a way off from actual sports cars/supercars. 7:30 is a good time, but nothing great. Fuck you Edmunds. One trick pony my ass. Tesla should offer a performance track package like they do for the model 3. Upgraded brakes, tires, active aero, then run it. Nice thats not bad at all getting closer to ice finally but still a ways to go. Impressive as hell for a family sedan.  Going to order a plaid for daily duties once my viper build is done. Not bad, I mean even a 2017 Camaro ZL1 is faster, but still pretty amazing for a 4-dr... only like 4 or 5 4-drs are faster.  The new roadster is gonna crush!! Why is the time printed on Tesla letterhead? Doesnt that track publish it? So not even close to sub 7 minute like he initially claimed I guess plaid + was needed after all. Plaid sales just went off the hook! He followed up this tweet with:  Next will be modified Plaid with added aero surfaces, carbon brakes &amp; track tires (all things that can be done without Tesla being in the loop) What tires? This is what irks me about Tesla. Musk spoke a big game in 2019 and said they were chasing the fastest production sedan time, then said he thinks with a few more tweaks it can go under the 7 min mark.   Here we are 2 years later and it's 30 seconds slower than what was alluded at. Very very disappointing. This overpromise, under deliver motto of Tesla is infuriating for potential buyers and current owners who were duped into thinking that we finally have an EV that turns as good as an ICE car.   The Plaid being 12 seconds faster over a very fast track ie: it can use it's 400hp advantage over the Taycan for huge proportions of the track, tells me the plaid handles worse than the Taycan let alone ICE competitors like the M5CS, AMG GT 4 door etc.   Just as a comparison the BMW M4 competition (insert the M3 competition here too), did 7:30. With 501hp. The plaid has more than double the horsepower and got the same time. Both stock. Tells you what car enthusiasts like myself say about Tesla's dynamics as drivers cars. Roadster, youre up next. Wow, I totally misunderstood this post. I thought it was the record for fastest production of a car - literally how long it took to manufacture it.  Woosh! So, lemme get this straight. Tesla is making two autonomous AIs. One is being designed to be limited to 6mph so regular humans can outrun it as a safety feature in case it goes rogue.  The other one just set the world speed record at Nurburgring.  I think there is a flaw in their logic somewhere.

That's the quickest an EV has ever run in the green hell. Wanna see something about the roadster soon. Good job, now make an affordable car. Reminds me of the great acceleration announced for the tesla semi. Of course it is absolutely irrelevant for almost any user and people are interested in more practical metrics, but hey, at least you can use it for some ego boost during your midlife crisis. Some observations worth reading @ [     &gt;OBSERVATION 1: While the acceleration of the Plaid is FIERCE, there are some LONG coasting sections before braking zones where the driver is either choosing not to accelerate, or is not allowed to leading me to:   SPECULATION 3: If I want to conserve the brakes, keep the engine cool, or just generally be kinder to my car, I will also come off the gas way before the braking zone. In race mode, youre normally either braking or accelerating. I speculate that the driver was pushing up against a limitation of the car. Watch the coasting sections before Quiddelbacher Hohe (Flugplatz, for the heathens) and Schwedenkreuz, to see what I mean. Thats the schnitt right there. 14 seconds faster than a GTI clubsport with a 4 cylinder 2.0L engine.   I know they were ""letting off"" and ""coasting"" at some points (probably until they modify brakes and aero since it\'s so damn heavy) but I guess I was just expecting more from this run.  Anyone else feel that way? Is regenerative braking used on the track?",778,"Is it the full circuit or sport auto configuration? Until it's in my car I don't care /s Looks like the windshield broke  Man, one of the worst looking laps ever when it comes to cornering/handling. Massive weight has the same characteristics of a Model 3 under cornering load. The float, sawing away on the steering wheel. Only the fierce straight line power is what got that thing around so fast clearly. Driver was fighting that thing the entire way. Noted on a few long straight, especially the one at the end of the loop, how the car was limited to 260kph, or about 160mph. Impressive from one standpoint, not so much from a few other perspectives. I didn't know my car was solar powered  Yawn.  Wait until the Nevero.  Plaid is nice but no car stacks up to the Rimac.  Even ICE Panamera is 1 sec faster than this Plaid time. So does speed record actually refer to the average speed on the right or does he mean the lap on the left. 7:30 seems a bit slow to me. I can't wait to get my hands on one, throw a nitrous kit on it, and take it to the dragstrip! Bro I don't care we need affordable electric options, can we please talk about this supposed model 2? I heard the Plaid is a waste of money. Not even close to the fastest But... Edmunds says the Tesla Model S Plaid is a terrible car... Sorry, but it's a lousy result.

For example, SpaceX would equip structures with devices to discourage nest building and perching (e.g., monopole technology and visual fright devices).""

My entire family finds it inspirational to follow its progress. I believe this should be approved. Here are some strategic national interests this serves as well:  1. Assured access to space. 2. Strategic interests on the Moon and Mars. 3. Protect against China doing on the moon what they are doing in the South China Sea, should they establish a moon base first.

Seems pretty low considering it might take that many just for a single HLS mission. Elon Musk and SpaceX with the support/ partnership of Jared has now paved the way for a steady pipeline of astronaut training. NASA doesnt have the monopoly here. In order to venture out, and colonize, Cislunar, Lunar, Mars abs beyond, an entire cadre of astronauts with different experience sets will all need a set or subset of astronaut training.  Access to space is a natural path. Its mans destiny to move to the stars. More importantly its critical that we do so, for the basic reason that we have to protect our human race; preservation of our species. Its about life on Earth. This path was laid out many  times in the past.  It took a couple billionaires to make the investment to insure this future. Unlike most political leaders, Elon Musk is a visionary.  And he gets shit done. *This is what I was able to come up with...*     Ms Stacey Molinich Zee    Environmental Protection Specialist    Federal Aviation Administration    800 Independence Avenue SW, Suite 325    Washington, DC 20591    Stacey.Zee@faa.gov    SpaceXBocaChica@icf.com         Dear Ms Zee:         For the following reasons I support approval of the SpaceX Starship orbital launch permit for Boca Chica, Texas:         We live on an exceptional planet, the only planet that we are aware of that supports life.  Yet everyone takes for granted the oxygen that we breathe, the pure H2O that falls from the skies, and the food that grows on trees.  Effectively preserving this amazing planet for thousands of generations into the future is not the top priority of the general public.         Strangely enough, public perception of the importance and beauty of this planet was largely triggered by a single photograph taken in 1968 by Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders while in orbit around the Moon and a Christmas wish for peace for all of you on the good planet Earth.         In the future, should Starship enable sustained manned research stations on the Moon and Mars, the formidable ISRU challenges of producing sufficient quantities of food, water, and air (as well as radiation protection!) for teams of geologists, astronomers, doctors, and engineers should help further drive home the enormous value and vital importance of this amazing planet that we are all so dependent upon.         And if we are to come up with effective solutions to keep Planet Earth healthy and happy for so many years into the future we will need a great deal of scientific/engineering talent, drive, and imagination.  We may need to confront formidable challenges, beyond current CO2 production rates, such as antibiotic-resistant pathogens, pandemics, solar flares, supervolcanoes, magnetic field reversals, asteroid impacts, and the slowly increasing brightness of the Sun.         And as Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson has pointed out, a visibly active space exploration program is the most effective driver of student interest and enthusiasm for STEM. So many American innovators over the past decades can point to the Apollo moon landings as what inspired them to become engineers rather than lawyers or accountants. Who wouldnt love to have their name attached to the discovery of life on Europa, or other exciting possibilities?         Finally, I would like to point out a more down-to-earth environmental benefit of the Starship development program.  Because Starship will be rapidly reusable with a minimum requirement for maintenance resources, it will be a much less environmentally-demanding way to put vital communications, earth observation, military, and scientific payloads into space.  The manufacturing and operation of a single starship will require a much smaller human footprint than the vast army of engineers and technicians required to manufacture and operate the hundreds of expendable launch vehicles that one starship will replace.  Instead, we may be able to redirect these talents and resources towards more vital and productive objectives.         In closing, I would like to observe that just as the environmental movement was triggered by NASAs Apollo program, Starship will open up an exciting new field of space resource management for surface operations on the Moon, Mars, dwarf planets such as Ceres, planetary moons, such as Europa, and asteroids such as Vesta.  Planetary protection measures for Mars and Europa should be particularly interesting and exciting.        Thank you for allowing me to share this perspective, and very best wishes!  &amp;#x200B;  *my name and address...* do we just comment on twitter or is there an official faa place to submit? Sent:  Dear FAA,  Please consider approving SpaceX Starship for the following reasons. Starship will:  - Dramatically increase the United States' technological and economic advantage in launch services and Solar System development  - Increase the US's national security in the orbital satellite and logistical domain  - Preserve humanity in case Earth suffers a catastrophe by enabling settlement of Mars  - Inspire future generations to pursue science and technology, via a revolution in space exploration  As a proud American, I fear for our upcoming great power competition with the authoritarian PRC. Orbital launch capabilities developed in a free market can be a substantial sustained competitive advantage across multiple domains. Conversely, the PRC is demonstrably working very hard to duplicate Starship's design and development. Let's stay ahead of them while exemplifying American ideals.  Thanks, Signed Crazy to think that I'm likely to have children within the next year or so, and my grandchildren have a great chance of stepping on Mars.   Lucky fucks, I'll be so proud of them. Here's what I wrote:  To whom it may concern,  My name is Texasauras and I am a US Citizen and resident of Austin, Texas. I have been following SpaceX's Boca Chica activities and development for a couple of years. I also visited the site in-person and inspected the areas surrounding their facility in June of 2020. After reading the Draft Programmatic Environmental Assessment recently released by the FAA, I want to offer the following comments and opinions.   First and foremost, I believe the importance of this project cannot be overstated. SpaceX's plans to develop the Superheavy Booster and Starship are vital to our nation's continued leadership in space exploration as well as national security and commercial interests. For this reason, it is my opinion that SpaceX should be granted wide latitude to develop and operate their Superheavy and Starship program.   I believe the FAA should grant a waiver so that SpaceX does not need to mitigate the following environmental impact categories: Visual Effects, Cultural Resources, Department of Transportation Act, Section 4(f) and Land Use. With respect to Biological Resources, SpaceX should implement all suggested mitigation activities except the contracting of a qualified biologist during both construction and operation, for which SpaceX should also be granted a waiver. With respect to all other environmental impact categories, SpaceX should be required to implement the proposed mitigation activities as outlined in the report.   I humbly urge the FAA to promptly approve SpaceX's permit for construction and operation of their facility and vehicles with the measures implemented as outlined above. Thank you for your time and consideration. Is this just for Americans.

Everyone is being nice for beta Interesting how this beta went from ""anyone who wants it can have it"" to ""request button"". The anticipation! I'm hoping it happens followed with actually getting the beta in 7 days. Will the button work tho? ![gif](giphy|nDSlfqf0gn5g4)  Tomorrow morning be like Does anyone see a problem with this?  Suppose the algorithm reports that you are not a safe driver therefore NO FSD (SOUP) for you. The only problem is you already paid for the SOUP and there are no refunds.  But it is BETA someone says.  Yes, but so is all the other software and it might be 10 years before the software is not beta.  So would that mean you would not get the software until it was no longer beta? &gt; Always new firmware for changes like this. We can't change things like that without a new firmware rollout. Wish we could. Would shorten down time on smaller changes. !remondme 14 days What if this is just an [elaborate painted door test]( ![gif](giphy|GwRBmXyEOvFtK)  Never thought I would be so excited about having my driving monitored, but here we are. I think tonight might not be an update in the classic download notification.   When I purchased the speed increase via the app, the option just showed up on my car instantly.  I wasnt ask to download an update - I just got the speed boost with a notification on the screen that I did. &gt; 10.1 not tonight :(. Big things coming in 10.1, hence the delay. Button will be rolled out to *some* cars tonight, but biggest rollout will happen tomorrow afternoon or evening. Just got an app update on iOS. Is that related? I subscribed to fsd this afternoon, after 1 week I'll be fsd ready for my road trip next week And of course my car has been in the service center since Tuesday sigh Nothing yet.  What time to check? Does anyone know if this is USA only? 9:49 pm California time and no button on my app yet (version 4.1.0). Got a beep on my phone and I rushed to it. Turns out its just the Uber eats app trying to give me free food at 10pm. Im such a fatass Will the button be available to those who haven't paid the full amount for FSD, just the default regular lane keeping autopilot that came with the car? Will the button be available internationally? Or just within the US, anyone know? I'm afraid the server will overloaded overnight lol After 1am PST and nothing in the car sw or phone app...WTH :/.  Anyone see it yet?? After 1am PST and nothing in the car sw or phone app...WTH :/  Anyone see it yet?? I have a software update available [Can confirm the button is real! ]( It's bring pushed now via sw update. Tesla discord is blowing up.

Im too lazy to try right now. Wow, my car is making quite a few noises during this update install which is taking quite a while to happen.

Time to turn on Granny mode. Point 4.  How many $$$ can we expect the free HW4 to cost Tesla? Obviously is the right move to make it a free upgrade as HW3 is not powerful enough.   Tesla could have 2 million cars on the road by the time HW4 is released. That's 200-400 million dollars just for the hardware assuming a board cost of 100-200 dollars. Why do you think this person is a real tesla engineer? He is talking about cameras near the headlights being impossible due to 'frame rate'? Seems obviously fake. Good replies from him.  (I still wonder if he actually works @ Tesla though)? Could it be a fake?  &gt;Will older (HW3) cars need to be retrofitted in the future to HW4 for full self drive ?  &gt;For level 5, yes. The entire self driving industry severely underestimated the processing power required to read and interpret vision data.  &gt;Is the AP team aware of the issues for unprotected left turns in FSD beta (as videos recorded  by @chazman)?  And the ongoing debate within the Tesla community regarding the requirement of additional headlights cameras to detect oncoming traffic blocked by obstructed view.  &gt;Headlight cameras won't make much of a difference :(. At that point the frame rate for each camera will also be too low. We don't want to have a one step forward, two step backwards situation.  &gt;So Elon said on AI day that HW3 is still capable of reaching 3x safer than humans..and HW4 would be 10x safer than humans.. So HW3 can comfortably reach SAE L3 before it runs out of compute, right?  &gt;Yeah... But we would rather jump to level 4 instead. For now let's keep it level 2 advanced.  &gt;HW4 is a bit far into the future, but I'm pretty sure you should be provided with all hardware and software for driverless full self driving no matter what if FSD was purchased. That was the promise.  &gt;10.1 not tonight :(. Big things coming in 10.1, hence the delay. Button will be rolled out to *some* cars tonight, but biggest rollout will happen tomorrow afternoon or evening.  &gt;We won't require you to drive like a grandma. Maintain a good following distance, and overall steady driving. Average speed above limit tolerance will be about 5-7 mph.  &gt;Autopark currently requires two vehicles and can only park in between. Can 10.1 - park in a lone spot without needing reference is 2 vehicles? - parallel park in first/last spot of the street? - recognize and avoid fire hydrants and reserved spots?  &gt;Not 10.1 but probably 11.   From Teslascope:  &gt;There are also some signs pointing towards making insurance payments directly via the mobile app, as well as uploading details of incidents (with photos).  &gt;Additionally, you may soon be able to directly purchase a vehicle via the mobile app, without having to visit the website Do you need FSD for the button? Or can you have autopilot and then like buy the sub if you get the beta I would HOPE #4 is a free upgrade for FSD owners. Can you imagine how many customers would be upset if they would have to pay for an upgrade? Goodness, and 10K isn't enough???? 3 is interesting.  The Nav data is wildly off with the speed limits in my area. Plus, the interstate, 85% of my commute, was shifted about 30 yards north to allow wider lanes. So the autopilot thinks the speed limit is 30thats not gonna fly when everyone else is doing 65.   Edit : removed the leading # (not sure why that was even in there) that apparently makes its bold and very  large font. #3 is surprising for freeway driving I feel like I just got HW3 lol. But if true, happy to get another upgrade and stay as future-proofed as possible. In my area the speed is limit is 55 but everyone drives 80+ . They will hate you if you drive at 60. The iPhone Tesla app just updated on my phone. If you look at images he replied too him on Twitter from teslascope it shows your Tesla driving score images My car just downloaded a 24.63MB file from vehicle-files.teslamotors.com This guy does not work for Tesla, get out of here with this BS. Just look at his old tweets, it's very obvious he's just larping. What if you normally drive 5-10 mi/hr under speed limit?  I'm almost always on the slowest lane following the fastest car...  I find 65 on the highway gives the best mileage.... I bought FSD because of #4. No way in hell hw2 was going to deliver working EAP. Also no way hw3 will deliver true FSD.  I'm going to get years of upgrades for $2k. My car is downloading 2021.32.22 right now - only see a couple other reports of it.  Looks big. Someone in here posted a link for information about the safety score.  [  Here\'s some info from the FAQ:.     --Your vehicle must be on software update 2021.32.22 or later. To check the latest software version on your car, tap \'Software\' on your touchscreen.      --You need to take a trip thats at least 0.1 miles on your vehicle.      --The Safety Score formula ignores any events (not just Forward Collision Warnings) that occur while Autopilot is engaged and appropriately utilized. This does not include Forced Autopilot Disengagments.  Good thing AP does not affect the score!  --Your Safety Score is vehicle specific. If you have more than one Tesla vehicle, each one of your Tesla vehicles will have its own Safety Score.  So looks like it doesn\'t matter if you or your grandma drives because this is all vehicle specific. Makes sense to me since you could just keep creating new profiles to ""reset"" your score and insurance is by vehicle anyways. My 2020 M3 is downloading 2021.32.22 now. Just got it this morning I received the update, but Id rather them not monitor me, so Im not downloading it. So... With the update that is actually happening, means this Twitter person is not reliable source of info? Weird. I have three cars, the three got it at exactly the same time. I suppose they are targeting accounts, not cars? there are portions of the highway here in central Florida where the speed limit says 30mph on screen (because they are redoing the roads) ap will go down to 30 when the speed limit is actually 60mph so I wonder what I can do to get around this? this has been a problem now for 3 years. Wait, I thought everyone got the button. I updated my Plaid while I was washing it and then got in and agreed to the FSD Beta terms. I didn\'t realize that there was a ""some""",289,"what happens if you enable to track your car, and your wrap foil paper around the GPS and LTE? Surely if you have no connection it is not fault of yours. I know I have been in remote places where you get no form of connection, those people can't be penalized for not sending constant feedback.

Started updating and sneaked to the garage risking my wife's wrath of potentially waking our 1 yr old baby at 4:30 am.  I don't want to miss the opportunity and I am glad I got to hit the button as soon as I was able to just in case there is a limit to number of tester they'd allow. You\'ll totes mcgoats be able to ""opt-in"" whenever you get it back, it\'s going to be limited as in there\'s plenty of people who will be too bad of drivers to be in the Beta. You can press the button at any time if your car has the option. Once you press the Button and agree to the terms, you'll be tested and scored then put in a que to enter the Beta. It doesn't matter if you pressed the button today or a week from now. Don't sweat it. Nobody here knows... we have no way of knowing how many people they intend to let in. To late for....what? I mean it's a beta. Just because you join and 7 days have passed by doesn't mean you'll get complete access to the FSD beta. Most presume it'll be a handpicked few of who have done well in certain states while continuing to monitor those in other states to add a week or two later.  Don't let a beta push you down. Yes it may be fun to join but you also gotta realize that your driving habits will have to change HEAVILY. I for one chose to wait.  In the end, don't sweat it. Enjoy life and keep doing what you're doing. I never got the update nor button yet so dont feel too bad, had them car snd FSD since day one",30,,0

I\'m pretty sure one of the ""hard braking"" was me overriding AP during a phantom brake though.  Oh well. Some day. What happened to early FSD buyers (pre $2k sale) getting early access?  Tesla blog post commiting to this: I got the fastest and hardest AP red screen yesterday for seemingly no reason. Eyes on the road, hands on wheel perfectly to satisfy nag, and no cars around. I must have grabbed it quick enough, because I still have my 100. Felt like the car was trying to trick me into a mistake. Im going to be so nervous now. This time at least they can support early FSD buyers by giving higher preference to them along with Safety score. After next My first score was a 28 for following to closely. Apparently, Tesla has never driven in rush hour in NYC. So no one is getting it until midnight Oct 8 based on the correction. Got dinged slamming on my brakes trying to avoid some jackass swerving in my lane Anyone know of a fix to get the Android app to update and show the safety score? Updated over the weekend and enrolled in wait list... Still no safety score. It can only be accessed through the app, right?

Ive lost count of how many times I know AP was about to screw me over and I had to hard break for it. But no thats on me that AP sucks. Where is individual safety score found? Keep dreaming everyone I need to move my score up quick!!! Is it still $10K to upgrade? Any else having issues with false positives? I have been keeping a close eye on how the system is capturing information and on which events. But there are times I see issues that didn\'t exist.  For example, last night it said I had a ""hard braking"" event. There was no point in that trip that I would have classified anything as a hard braking event under manual driving. And I has to be under manual driving because Elon indicated that AP\'s behavior wouldn\'t be counted. I also had a following too close but again, unsure when that was. The only time I could see that was at a stop light and I was only closing the gap so it wasn\'t excessive.  I would be nice to have more clarification on how it classifies some of these events because I have been cautious in my driving, like I can assume everyone else has been trying to be. Because most of our daily driving shouldn\'t ding us but obviously is thus us increasing our in cautiousness in our driving behavior.  Has anyone noticed any other weird events that\'s reporting that it probably should not have? Because I know that none of us really want to lose our ranking because of something that it was reported, that was not our fault. My score is dropping because there is a tight turn on my work route and you have to follow traffic. I keep getting dinged for aggressive turning. Yeah, its New England the roads are old cow paths. WTF? And today I got one for stopping aggressively at a notorious red light camera that just turned yellow. Im 4 days in As well, I didnt get the buttons till Saturday. 97, 100, 99, 100, over all 99. Hopefully Ill be at 100 by the end of the week. I was cut off the two days I got lower scores and tailgating a bit I guess. I have a total of 200 miles right now. Seems like the yellow lights are all cooperating together to work against me. Every yellow light has been questionable, I dont want to slam in the brakes but I also dont want to run a red light. Hopefully Im granted the FSD soon. I feel like we need to have a thread, kind of like a daily roll call just to get an idea of how many people are managing to stay at a 100. It would be helpful to kind of gauge where we are all falling in.",351,"Anyone know if the FSD following distance setting (1-7) affects the Unsafe Following score? I just drove 52 miles in the middle of the night on an empty freeway, with all but 2 miles on FSD. The rest was on empty roads. My score said ""60% unsafe following"" for the trip. How can this be? Only thing I can think of is that I am getting dinged because my following distance for FSD is set to 3? Do I need to change it to 7? The instructions say I shouldn\'t lose points at all when on FSD. Just think some of 100 score people screwed up and Tesla stopped it lol RIP 99 and below Bad title. Tweet was plan is to. Who would ever pay for FSD now when you have to drive safely according to our score to even be granted access??  How about you assess my driving first, then charge me when you think I deserve it. I got a stupid fcw today when I wasn't even close and now I'm angry I have a 99. Hopefully the next few days of driving, I can get it back to 100",18

As I said before, lots of angry 100 safety score people will arise next week when they see it's not enough for them to have the beta. &gt;Wow, lot of interest in FSD beta!  How can he still be surprised that people who paid thousands of dollars want the thing they paid for? It would be cool to try and gauge stats on how the queue is going. Like how many have hit the button, what the distribution of scores is, when you could expect to hear back based on a certain score. Of course it would probably be community driven instead of official, but maybe fun. Eh. I think Ill go back to enjoying my car. I bet there are a ton of 100s and 99s. Where do I find the score in the app?   I clicked on the approval for the beta, I updated the app.  Still can't see a score anywhere. Is the expectation to drive every day, or is a certain number of miles going to be sufficient? I've driven 390 miles in three days and averaged a 98. I honestly might just drive my junker for a few days.     Also, I'm not sure how many FSD cars there are, but there's a good chance it's \\~150k cars. If everyone's doing this thing and getting reasonable scores, it could be a very long time before it's rolled out at 1,000 users per day. The only thing that the safety score indication has taught me, is that I should blast through yellow lights. Does anyone know if there is a minimum amount of miles we should be driving per day? Ive only needed to drive twice (less than 20 miles total) and Im trying to avoid unnecessary trips. My score is currently at 100 and Id like to keep it there for the full 7 days. I just want to take a step back and look at the bigger picture here. Forget about Tesla for a second and just think about this moment in time and how it is most likely one of those moments that will send humanity down a completely new path. Imagine being a member of one of the first internet message boards in the early 90s, thats essentially where we are with autonomous vehicles and over the next several months we will see tens of thousands of consumer vehicles drive themselves from point A to point B with little to no human intervention, this has never happened before.   This is truly a monumental change that will be in history books from the future. So no downloads at all until at lease Oct. 8th, with 10.2  then, 1000 a day based on safety score. It could actually take months to get the FSD beta.  This is disappointing. Man, my score is 78 now. There's no way I'm going to get it before someone does something stupid and NHTSA makes Tesla shut it off. What bullshit. Theres no way the score is accurate enough to be prioritizing it like that, with the kind of standard deviation it must have. I cant remember the last time Ive gotten FCWs, and gotten several on this version in the last 2 days alone. What happened to early FSD buyers (pre $2k sale) getting early access?  Tesla blog post commiting to this: If only play store users could see their safety score... 2000 people have perfect 100 scores?? Let's get him to confirm there is no miles minimum. I wonder if I should stop driving this week or roll the dice. I have been 99 to 100 over 100 miles... my wife borrowed my car for 20 miles and got a 30 i now have a 78... Is it possible to get back to 100 after your score dropped? Or will it stop at 99? Can we just get an updated app on the play store? I want to see my score I think I was ok with the idea of this when it was going to be given out to everyone who had achieved a decent enough score (80+ seemed to be the inferred good driver threshold, judging by the Safety Score overview).  As it is, the notion that there will be limited blessings of people who get 100, 99, 98, etc turns it into a bit of a tease. I mean just how much more have owners got to prostrate themselves to get access to something theyve already paid for?  Just have a threshold for good driving and let those who have achieved that for 7 days get on it. They could (and should) keep evaluating people in 7 day blocks (or less, for particularly egregious and consistent drops in score) so that people who start driving badly after getting on the beta are replaced by people who improved their driving etc.  I see no reason this cant be like examinations where passing thresholds for different grades are set based on expectations of how many people will achieve said grades. If Tesla dont want 25k on the beta, set the threshold higher - but dont tease people with altered qualification criteria mid exam. I got unlucky in my first mile and got a fcw from cars that were waiting in line for star bucks. Cant recover from that massive point deduction.  Got myself up to 86 (from 60!). Dont think Ill be able to pull it up to 97+ in time, lol. New GPU  Xbox Series X  Playstation 5  FSD Beta   ...which one will I get first, I wonder. Just stop worrying about this until 2022. Youll be far happier. Yikes I have a 76. Wont be seeing FSD for a year I guess Well now Im pretty annoyed that one stupid nonsense FCW when I was going 3mph in a parking lot and the lot attendant ran over to talk to me knocked me down to 96. To get back to 100 Id have to drive 200 miles with no warnings at all and I drive like 20 miles a day. Woah So Ive calculated my highest possible score after my day 1 snafu if I drive perfectly for rest of the week. Best I can do in 7 days is a 97.   Backstory - got an fcw on my first day, first mile. Didnt know how sensitive shit was and got a 65should have kept driving to get that score up in the same day.   Going forward: it looks like it averages the daily score without regard to how far the car is driven. Im going to just drive the car around the block, get perfect scores in all categories and drive the other car. After 7 days (4 more days)  Ill end up with a 97.  Yea, Im salty! Cheers to those with 99s and 100s. I hope you get it on day 1. Went on ONE drive yesterday, to the grocery store. (1.5 miles away)   \\* The only time I had someone in front of me I kept a follow distance of 3 car lengths.   \\* I didn\'t let full regen kick in and instead feathered the throttle way early to slow down even more gently.   \\* The very few turns I made, I turned so slowly that I could have had an open scalding hot cup of coffee between my thighs and wouldn\'t have worried about it.  Despite making probably the most gentle, safe drive in my life, I still got dinged in the red for ""Aggressive Turning"" and ""Unsafe Following"".  WTH? Yeah no shit a lot of interest, we paid for it years ago and still havent received shit for it. 97...96.........3...2...1...Blast-off I'm super curious what happens at the tail end of this.  Do they release an L2 system to drivers that score badly because they are willing to pay? Do drivers who score badly only get FSD at some unknown date in the future when it hits L3? And how does this work with paying customers? Heres a crazy idea. Prioritize by when people paid for FSD. Can I just get a refund instead at this point? I already got a huge ding from a completely false FCW and now have to play the game of trying to avoid all of the situations where Im dinged because of bad Tesla code for weeks to get access to a product I paid for. Safety score is buggy as hell. I drive like a grandma and got a forward collision warning out of nowhere today when I was pulling off onto an exit without being near a car. Dropped my score from a 99 to a 90. Ugh i did 700 mile road trip yesterday and had a 98. took my pup to daycare this morning (in a city) and got a 87. this shit is biased so hard to non-city driving its hilarious. you cant drive through boston without hard braking For the life of me I cant figure out where to find my rating.

My 100 score is doomed. BSD for babysitting self driving.  The points this sounds like the fifth element movie. Haha. Im really surprised people want what they paid for a long time ago. Weird. One question I havent seen asked  will we be expected to maintain a safety score over a certain level once we have access, or else lose access to the FSD Beta? I know they have the right to revoke at any time, but if we need to maintain a score above, say, 95.it wont even be worth it. I had a hard braking/collision warning incident last night.  Car pulled out in front of mine without looking. All I could think about afterward was that she messed up my possible FSD beta invitation. I get a lot of unsafe following. Even when I follow at the same distance AP does.  A lot of interest? Yeah Elon. These are the same people who gave Tesla an interest free loan years ago for a feature yet to be delivered. Of course theyre freaking interested in finally seeing something in return I am baffled by the safety rating system. I drove a four mile (6.4 km) round trip to the post office in my very small town, not ONCE using the brakes but only releasing the accelerator and never exceeded 25 mph (40.2 km/h). I was deliberately being super careful. I had no vehicles in front or behind me within visible range at any time or any potential obstacles in my path. There are no stop signs or street lights either on that route. Yet when I got home and checked my safety score, I had been hit with a ""hard braking"" penalty. I\'m just completely frustrated and it\'s making me afraid to drive lest I incur more false penalties and lose out on qualifying for the beta. Makes sense. Still wish it would show us a GPS flag for where we had issues. One thing to keep in mind is that the safety score isnt just a rating of you as a driver, but also of the environment you are driving in. Thats because the whole point is to minimize the chances of a bad accident and the resulting PR shitstorm. So its not just about you, but also the maniacs you have to drive with.  And yeah, there are a ton of rough edges in the system. The one ding Ive gotten so far is an aggressive turn, it was turning onto a busy Main Street from a full stop. Probably pulled .400001 gs. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob) The safety score is so arbitrary, and as many commenters pointed out, riddled with issues due to Autopilot mistakes, false Forward Collision Warnings, etc. How about turn on the interior camera and score purely based on attentiveness since that's the only thing that actually matters? Anyone have data for a trip not show up on your safety score data? My drive home from yesterday is missing, but all other drives are there. do we HAVE to drive 7 days for it to count? Time to go farm my score up with FSD enabled on the highway late at night   sitting at a 98 right now This is really a huge slap in the face and just gives Elon to drag us along for an extended period of time.. smh Whats the best way to get the rating up?? It seems like you need to drive a certain number of miles with 100 percent ITT. A lot of people learning they are in fact bad drivers. Im about to record my damn drive to prove a few things. This morning was 95% autopilot. Gave me a 99 score but marked be severely for following to close when the 5% had no one in front of me, absolutely no one.. My car has follow set to 2, and was never encountered anything close to anyone except a stop light it took itself to.. The comprehension I have to how this score is generated is numbing to me haha.. Plot twist: only like 5 people have 100 and in three weeks well be down to people with 74 getting the beta. Is the beta. Button and driving score only for people who have fsd paid for? How about prioritizing by who paid for it first or at least who paid the most? Im so confused how there hasnt been class action lawsuits about FSD yet. People want access to something they paid $10k for... *Shocked Pikachu face* (I know some of these will have paid less than $10k though.) WOW! These customers actually want something for the $10,000 they gave us! lolz By interest. Do you mean ""everyone who already paid for it wants it""? Who would have guessed people who paid $10k for FSD would want the FSD beta.   For others who don't have it yet, Tesla service told me yesterday that the button is being pushed out to a very small sample for now. I've got a 100 (based on about 20 cumulative miles since Saturday) but am road tripping  500 miles this weekend. Seems unlikely to hold... So will miles driven play a role? Seems a bit odd if someone can qualify by getting 100, driving less than or only a couple miles while others who drive 100's of miles in a week will be held to the same scrutiny. Who would have guessed people are interested in a thing they paid thousands of dollars to use? How do you check score? I have been driving for 36 years and never had an accident or even a ticket. I am an extremely safe driver. I get big discounts on my current insurance because of it. That being said, I live in metro Los Angeles and I am getting dinged for FCW\'s because others suddenly cut in front of me because I am trying to keep a ""safe distance"", or they suddenly decide they are going to make a turn and I have to ""hard brake"" right as the collision warning is going off. These are not my fault. I am driving like a grandma and under the speed limit. The excitement of finally being able to get FSD is becoming an unfair annoyance. A lot of interest? You're telling me that people are inserted in having a glimpse of what they paid 6-10 thousand dollars for? Weird. I have a Model S with HW3 and purchased FSD back when it was $3k.  I have the newest update of the app, but my car doesnt show any new updates available.  Am I just in line waiting for this new version to hit my car? Or should I raise a service request. Did Musk ever tell 100/100 safety score over so many miles? I'm sure driving 2 miles a day and maintaining a 100/100 isnt going to cut it, is it?  With work from home, currently it is me driving kid to the school and back during week days. I don't want to drive just for the sake of driving. How do I check my safety rating? ""Wow, lots of interest in (that thing people paid for years ago and still haven\'t gotten)!""  &amp;#x200B;  ... you think? In other news, Tesla insurance posts a large profit after drivers started driving obsessively slowly for some reason. Do we know what 10.2 will add? For some reason I don't see my safety rating anywhere. Can anyone explain how I see it? I'm already in queue If the onboarding is with 100 safety score first. Would it be based dynamically on our safety scores, or will the initial 7 day score after requesting be used?  Also, if its 100 score starting, how long do you guys think it'll be trickled down to most users. I wouldn't be surprised if thats like 40k people with 100 score My score on day one was a 3, the rest were a 98. Does anyone else have this anomaly? It's dropping my score WAY down.   * I drove the same on the first day as every other day. It's saying I had all kinds of FCW, and I didn't Maybe they should be prioritizing release to the lower safety scores since they would benefit more from FSD rather than their manual driving habits? I think the score rating is as much data about the area you live in as anything. Tesla wouldn't want beta in the most difficult to drive places right out the gate. So people with a 100 must live in super easy to drive places.  I bet if they averaged your score on a curve based on the area you live it would be clearer.  Counting down from 100 is the best way to train the fleet both from a driver and location standpoint.  At 1000 per day, everyone with FSD should have access to the beta in a year at least and hopefully, before then, FSD feature complete is ready.  If they get it to the point that as long as I'm sober and in the vehicle, I don't have to pay attention, I'm happy. Video games, movies, internet, sleep? If they are on the table I'm so ready. IMO a beta software feature that self drives a 4000 pound car should require a safety score of 100 all the time. I had a forwarded collision warning come on 20+ ft ahead of a car stopping at a stop sign, going 20 mph, it's gunna be a looong time before I get to try what I paid for I was 97 for the past three days.  And then I took a ride today for 5 miles, kept incredibly distant from everyone, drove under the speed limit, never took hands off the wheel or was distracted.  Somehow when I looked at my safety score it said I had made 99 Forward Collision Warnings within that one ride and it booted my score down to a 73.  I know the safety score is a beta but this is ridiculous.  Now I will never get the beta all because of an error on Tesla's part.  I'm getting sick of this sort of thing from the company!!! Tesla's forward collusion warning is flawed.  When you slow down by half releasing your acceleration pedal, tesla treats it as an acceleration even when the car is decelerating.  When I car go in front of your side way, you decelerate by half releasing the acceleration pedal knowing that it will soon be gone, nope, Tesla gives you that stupid Forward Collusion Warning. EAP owners like me will gladly wait until this thing actually works and the button is real (by real I mean you qualify even if you dont have 50,000 followers on Twitter and send daily tweets to Elon saying how sexy he looked on SNL)  then I will gladly pay $99 a month and if turns out to suck no big deal! I will simply cancel. Arent we geniuses? We saved thousands in the process by just getting EAP and now Tesla will have to be accountable on this if they want our subscription money marketing and tweet stunts will not suffice. Are you going to spend $3000 dollars in Canada to upgrade your Tesla Safety rating? They need to find a way to normalize the scores by geographic area. Easy to get 100/100 if all you do is drive open highways in the middle of nowhere. In NYC pretty impossible to get anywhere without being slightly aggressive. Im a pretty tame driver and I cant get above 90. It keeps thinking Im following too closely but you have to do that or youll just keep getting cut off. Whats FSD? #newb I just finally figured out how to get the apkmirror version installed, and now can check my score. I am at 96, and unsafe following was the major issue. I also had to try and avoid a rolling bucket on the highway the other day. I managed to clip it, but it looks like the bucket had more damage.  From here on out, my goal will be to avoid driving during rush hour. Still enjoy the fact that you can buy FSD under the premise that you\'ll get it when it becomes available, you can be teased that you\'ll be allowed into the ""early access program"" if you have pre-bought FSD long before the EAP announcement, but after all that, you can get de-prioritized for FSD access because you live in a place with bad traffic (the most common cause of hard braking and close follow distance). Got dinged for Hard Braking. I gently slowed for a yellow light. I agree with the Consumer Reports article, Teslas New Safety Score could Lead to Unsafe Driving, a CR Evaluation Shows Interesting that there are no more new FSD beta post and that the sub has few other post and some of the old post are locked. Hmmm. My theory is, it is not about our safety score. It is about an AI complexity score. Only people in places that have very simple scenarios will still have a 100%, so FSD will have an easier time.  I would love to see FSDs score. It brakes way later and harder than I do when I get dinged for just full regen.   Love to see Musk's personal score.  Also, pissing people off by nitpicking their driving with beta software might just make people nitpick FSD right back.",2226,"Dropped to 99 because some asshole cut me off. Aggressive turning because I turned down hill. WTF Elon I got a forward collision alarm two days ago.  I\'ve gotten false positives before when rounding a tight bend because the sensors think a parked car is in my lane, but I\'ve never gotten one ""legitimately.""  This one involved a vehicle stopped at a stop sign.  I was approaching and the vehicle started to go, but then stopped suddenly.  It sucks because that is a huge hit on your score.  I\'m back up above 95% now, but I\'d be around 99/100% without that. Took a drive after 22 on the highway. 100 club now I've seen 3 posts aside from my own where following distance was 60% in the red, but they're at 99.  It's not working correctly The day *before* I pressed the button I got 3 fcws in 10 seconds on an empty, straight but hilly/shadowy rural highway. It disabled cruise control, but I was able to put AP back on in seconds.  Glad I waited as it's safer to just do a few tiny trips daily lol Just fix the ui first please! Need some changes on there How are people seeing their scores anyway?  I opted in but don't see anywhere with a number I have a 95 because I hard braked at a yellow light, is tesla saying I should have went through it instead? Its not like I was speeding. Have they said anything about not counting collision warnings in garages? Mine dings constantly when pulling in. How can you see your rating? Where are people seeing their safety score?  I think it's supposed to be in the tesla app but I'm not seeing it.  I do have the latest Tesla software version and I have hit the button to join the queue. Them folks with 49 going to be driving themselves for a while. Lol. My score is setting at about 92 overall.  Today I had a 97 at first (first Time I have ever been dinged for hard turns) but was fine.  on the way home.. i got dinged with a double FCW, both times due to a car getting OUT of the lane I was in (one turning off the road) the car is just so bad at that. Ended up dropping to a 90.  Video of one of the people turning that got me a FCW:   My big question is.. If I want to raise it.. Should I be driving by hand where there are a lot of stop lights to raise the breaking score?  or should i be on a highway with AP for an hour or two with a good audio book.   I dont know whats going to help the score overall.    Will AP breaking ,help my break score? or does being on AP just mean it wont make it go down, but wont count at raising it. Screw this. Give me my money back. Seriously. Im happy with my 2018 MX, but this is total crap.   Theyre changing the rules of this nonsense. If all drivers just agree to drive like shit you can all get beta with 20/100 The fact that people have to earn something they paid 10 GRAND for infuriates me. I'm getting a Model Y LR, but I'm not going to pay the $10K. I'll do subscriptions if anything at all. I refuse lol. Call me petty but... ""People want what I\'ve been promising them for 5 years and they paid for?! WHAT?!""  Edit: Bootlickers out in full force today I see. Testing on their customers I just drove 10 miles in Chill mode with Autopilot on 99% of the time.  Only made one turn and glacial speed.  Got dinged for ""Hard Braking"".  Scored 97.  I\'m pretty sure it\'s physically impossible to get better then that in a Model S Performace +.  The system is rigged for non-performance cars. How are they going to decide who gets to be in on the FSD Beta? Cant everyone join in? What if everyone presses the button? How do they decide or pick who the first ramped-on 1000 ones are?",28

It appears this safety thing was just a delay tactic in disguise. Theres no true discernible driving difference between a score of, lets say, 90-100 lets get real. My marriage might not withstand this after the two days she drove. Mission impossible  (car is shared)  I wish they lowered it to a passing grade like 80 or something A perfect 100? So, basically it rolls out to nobody. I did an experiment. Drove one car normally, (90 score). Drove the other round the block and left it in the garage. (100). Fun things you can do when youre on paternity / maternity leave! Wonder if that car will get it. If so that seems a bit silly. Do we need to keep the safety score up until if/when we get it or does it stop caring after a week ? I was at a 99 till it arbitrarily gave me a 95 last night for aggressive turning. Now Im down to a 98 and I dont want to keep driving like a terrified grandmother. Wonder if existing beta testers get kicked out if they dont have score of 100. Still waiting for my button, on my new Model 3 that refuses to update past 2021.11.103. I already spent the $10K on FSD after spending $3K in 2018 so this is getting pretty annoying. (I know you reditters can't do anything to help, but thanks for the opportunity to vent). 100/100?!   My elementary school math tells me that fraction can be reduced down to 1 which is closer to my score.   [Buckle up everyone]( Had 100 after the first 5 or so days, but I\'ve gradually drove more ""normal"" and dropped to 98 lol. Shame.     I\'ve only had one false FCW, the rest of the strikes come from apparent aggressive turning, even though I\'ve been taking every one as agonizingly slow as possible and feeling bad for the people behind me. This seems to completely ignore the mileage driving under said score or when you purchased/subscribed to FSD.  Likely if you just subscribed to FSD and drove around the block every day, youll be higher up the queue than someone that drove high mileage with good safety score and paid for FSD a long time ago. As a Norwegian Tesla owner, I just wish they would enable the score calculation for all drivers. I would love to see what score I have in my regular driving. (And also get some hints on what one should improve on.) And if possible also link this to your driver profile. Wow, glad I spent the extra money just to be toyed with. Not possible in NYC. Get cut off, FCW. Turn into midtown tunnel - going 2 mph - aggressive turn. And cut off again - FCW. Every day. I'm amazed I'm even close to 80. Do you only get a safety score if you are enrolled in the FSD beta? I have the latest Model Y update and iOS app updates and don't see it anywhere. I have yet to recieve the safety score beta. I have FSD purchased and beta updates enabled. Anyone know what gives? I wonder if this means there are only about 1000 people with perfect scores and everyone with a 100 will get it or they are only selecting 1000 and lots more have a 100 score.  Also, the way it's worded, I bet he's talking about people who not only have a 100 score but **ALSO daily 100 scores**. I had 100 yesterday till I had a car swerve in front and I had to brake hard.  Bumped me down to 99.  Still excited to be in the toppish.  Maybe this coming week. So listen folks.  100 does not mean you are a great driver. It does not mean that your farts smell like roses and everyone likes the cut of your jib. It means you are the least risky candidate for the first rollout of the beta due to the environment you live in, the way you drive and the conditions you drive in. That's it. Tesla don't have a lot of resources to handle the mountains of bug reports that would come rolling in if they expanded it any other way.  So they are intentionally (and cleverly) using this as a way to have you drive your 50-150k car around like it's a 25mph golf cart. So when you enable beta you don't end up in a ditch and Tesla get a black eye in the media. Remember, Tesla have a MASSIVE target on their back. Massive. They don't want the bad publicity.  Fret not. It doesn't matter, you are not a bad driver, everyone will still swoon in your presence. It's OK. Wonder if they have a cut off for how many miles you had to drive? Waiting anxiously with 99 Just another delaying tactic. lol.  zero chance this roll out goes smoothly.  100% that some 99's or 90's will get it before i do, still driving like a granny and hanging onto a 100 score While I am personally no fan of driver monitoring, I found the tool that Tesla rolled out to be be surprisingly useful as an impartial arbiter of driving behavior. No one listens to their significant other when they nag them about following too closely, etc, so this really is great for no-nonsense driver improvement without the emotional drama. The fact that Tesla can give people per-trip feedback on several of these metrics effortlessly, for free, in near-real time is frankly astounding and as usual, absolutely shames the rest of the industry.  All that said, nothing is perfect and my wife mentioned she hesitated to brake hard for a crossing deer because she was worried about not getting into the beta. Not thrilled with that concept, and a good reinforcement of why no one should want their premiums based on this data. We also found that the unsafe following metric is too conservative and leaving SO much room between us and the leading vehicle at all times confuses drivers around us and was resulting in a constant stream of cars cutting us off. So we just do the best we can and typically sit around 98/99. Oh well. feel like a hamster yet? My bet based on nothing is that there will be a 4-7 day gap between 100 and 99, then a two day gap from there. I got dropped to 96 just for taking an onramp to a highway. i was dead in the middle of the lane and the car just went nuts with alarms like it thought i was driving off the side of the road. I would be furious if this system was actually used for insurance purposes. Yah... this is fucking bullshit. Silly question, what if I just start a new profile on my car and drive a mile or two? Is the score by profile or averaged together? Thousands of dollars for a chance to use the product Honestly wish there was some graphic indicator on the car to let you know what close following is, hard turning, and hard breaking.   I never drive on anyones ass and I got dinged for it. Had a collision warning when a car was crossing the intersection and I was going straight, so obviously wasnt going to it that person at all. Or when a car SLOWLY goes into the turning lane but I have plenty of space to move forward, thats a collision warning too because Tesla visuals takes too long to know a car is moving out of its lane  Im at a 97 but still upset on how stupid this is and its making me not like the driving experience anymore especially after spending $10k for this. Like big brother is always watching lol I took my car to go get its tires aligned. The mechanic drove it off as they always do after aligning. Surprisingly only thing they got me dinged for was aggressive turning. But there goes my 100. 99... and every time i get nicked it's for hard turning at a very busy freeway onramp where you have to move quickly so that others can get in a well. It's in no way unsafe and i refuse to be an asshole for that lady one percent. Is the midnight he refers to the midnight between today and tomorrow? Or Tomorrow and Saturday? Ive driven 500 miles in LA since hitting the button on day 1 and managed to keep my score at 98. I feel like this should matter a little bit, but its a non-nuanced silicon world. How do we report false scores??  I got forward collision warnings while in AP going through an intersection with the sun blasting the cameras... The sun set off forward collision warnings.... I also got unsafe following distance while in AP and a truck nearly side swiped me on the highway at 65 mph... ugh am I ever gonna get FSD lol :/ [Important additional context](  &gt;\tEveryone with a perfect score with get it. There are ~1000 owners with perfect scores. Maybe 1100 to 1200 by Friday night. So I guess this means I will be graded again for another week or two. Does it matter when you joined the queue?  I got my Model X back from service a couple days ago and joined the queue right away.  It has a Safety Score of 100 now.  Now I'm debating on driving it or not, lol.  Try to keep the 100 score. I had 100 after two days, but that quickly dropped to a 95 after driving longer distances.  Like everyone else, getting dinged for ""aggressive turning"", ""hard braking"" and ""un safe following"".     It\'s like the system expects you to look into the future and know exactly when cars cut in front of you, slam on brakes, or when lights turn yellow right at the point where you can still brake and not run it when it turns red.   It\'s apparent Tesla considers accident avoidance as unsafe. *cries in 99* I'm never getting that button anytime soon.   $8,000 wasted. This is certainly a delay tactic because (1) everyone with 100 should get in and (2) A 98 is certainly within margin of error for 100.   Everyone within the mathematical margin of error of 100 would get invited immediately if the button was placed there to truly go to wide release, but only to the safest drivers.  As were hearing, otherwise excellent drivers are being delayed because of random events. Thats the whole point of confidence intervals. I'm at a 98 now, any tips on getting my hard breaking from a 0.7 to much lower? Should I be using autopilot or does it's breaking not count in the score denominator? Don't suppose Elon would prioritize those of us with a perfect score, who paid for FSD 3+ years ago? Thanks to the two cars that pulled out directly in front of me yesterday taking me from 100 all week to 90. The real MVPs. Driving through DC this weekend was a mistake. Yet we dont even have stop light recognition in our country smh I got dinged for a guy peddling in the road right at a turn off. So sadly Im in the 99 crowd now. How do I check my scores?

The forward collision warnings, unsafe following, and hard braking are pretty much a way of life on the freeways and dense city streets. that goal post sure does move a lot 2017 Model S driver with prepaid FSD here trying to maintain our patience and 98 :-/ I live near a major 2 week long regional fair that covers several states and of course the safety score rolled out in the middle of dealing with that :(  I have a 96, but that is with one day that was a 68 due to fair traffic and general idiocy. Is it possible to get back to 100 from 99 or does 100 require a perfect score from the start? It is midnight in pacific time, correct? I wonder if ""perfect"" means 100.0 or if 99.50 counts as perfect. How many days of data do you need?    Sitting with a 100 score at 5 days of driving (25 miles/day) like my father and avoiding freeways. Been driving my non FSD M3 more to enjoy driving while I baby my MY which has FSD. Currently at 98. Beginning to think I should just drive and ignore this score. Would love to see the stats of how many perfect score beta participants who are refusing to drive until after Friday  Some fucker will crash on FSD mode and the whole fucking thing will get pushed back another year. Can't wait to test out the current version of FSD Beta in 2029 when they get to the 94s! Been waiting a year. I don't mind waiting a few more days until my cohort (98, thanks to my lovely wife /s) gets called. I have a 100 with 0.1 Hard braking. Does that mean I'm a candidate? That 0.1 hasn't changed for over a week. [The goalposts are using smart summon... ]( I dont get how the safety score isnt flawed?  My Autopilot is phantom braking all the time, which means its imagining non-existent cars and objects in my path.  Then I drive as annoyingly safe as possible, and I get dinged for a 35% following distance every time.  I think the judge of my driving should at least be able to see properly.  Edit: On second thought its not flawed. Its actually clever that the judge and product are one and the same. This allows Tesla to keep FSD away from bad drivers and environments where FSD would struggle. Judging both is baked in. This keeps FSD opinion among the people who got it positive and buys them time to improve it as they expand to more complex environments. My 94 and I will wait. I live in a big city and trying to get a 100 would probably get me in an accident. Got sick of trying to game the system to get 100. Running a 94 driving like normal and will get it when I get it. This process is a clown show. Perfect 100 here, maybe Ill get it.  I also only have 4 total miles driven lol. Honest question, what would happen if I made a new account and transferred my car to it, and drove perfectly for a mile, would I get it ? Ive seen some folks asking how to help your unsafe following score. If youre able to get on a relatively calm highway or street, if you can get a car in your lane just on the edge of your visualizer, the car considers you following. With this, I brought my unsafe following number from ~13.5 down to 4.0 last night with 60 miles of driving. It should be score combined with miles driven. 100/100 is easy to do if you never leave your neighborhood.  Edit: should also include days driven Checking my software every 2 minutes and still seeing 2020.48 :| How many of y'all have buyers remorse from the FSD purchase? Yeah but they dont want to roll out to too many people at once so this way they get just a 1000 people without it being all random and unfair. Not too bad actually imo, am no tesla owner however. geez out of all the beta button requestors only ~1000 had a perfect score? Would love to see Elon's Safety Score. Wtf. Was at 100 then got dinged for unsafe following this morning. I had that thing on AP 99% of the drive to work, and traffic was super light. Why does none of this surprise me?   What his statement says is that they really wanted to expand the Closed Beta to more users but using the ""Safety Score"" process to find more users. Not really making this beta more ""public"" but just to recruit more users. Do they factor in miles driven for the 100 score? What if someone just drove their car around a parking lot and left it to sit for all this time? Still have 97s on both of our cars. Fine to wait till next week or so. Been waiting this long. Just as long as the rollout happens/expands, that is progress.  Cant wait for all the new YouTube channels to pop up this weekend! So what you're saying is, my 75 safety score should get it sometime around 2029?  For reference, this is across 340(!) miles. Assuming those miles stay with me forever, I would have to drive over 5000 perfect (score 100) miles to get to a 99. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)  Getting to a 100 would require 17,000 perfect miles. What conditions are these people driving in where they can maintain perfect scores? The only thing I keep getting dinged with is ""unsafe following"", enough to drop me down to 96%, even though I leave 3-4 car lengths in front of me. Problem is highway driving, where you hardly ever get an opportunity for anything less than ""assertive"" merging. I\'d have to just circle the beltway till rush hour was over to maintain 100%. Getting a 100 (or a 99) really just proves you can follow arbitrary rules.   This is actually a really good thing for Tesla! These people have proved that they will jump through hoops to get access, don\'t want to lose it. They\'re ""good"" drivers only in the sense that they\'re really paying attention to what Tesla wants them to. Not a bad strategy. What I haven't seen anywhere (from Tesla, not speculation) is whether the score used for inclusion/exclusion will only be the original 7-day period, or whether it will be cumulative, since people authorized Tesla's use of that information.  The reason I'm not clear is that I believe the consent to share that information was limited to that 7-day period?  Not sure. I'm at a perfect 100 with 1500 miles driven. This is a large mix of city and freeway driving. There a spreadsheet/calculator that can be used to determine how to raise the score? That thumbnail is so penith I opted into this when it came out. But my app still doesn't show a score... It's been what? A week?  Maybe it's bec I'm in WA state? I highly doubt I'll ever get a 100 score, but it's odd that my car says I've opted in but nothing on my app (yes my app is updated to the latest version). Do people really have a 100?? Shouldn't full FSD go to the worst driver? Mine is 98 with 0 or fractionally close to 0 except for 20% unsafe following.    Its very hard to raise this number if I need to drive during busy times.  If I leave a gap too large, other cars just change lanes into   the gap.  I slow down to open the gap  repeat another car fills the gap.  This parameter part of the score favors drivers who can travel when theres fewer cars on the road Im in the top 10 of the 99ers on TeslaFi, small consolation I guess. Honest question: my Model 3 is just over 3 years old and I'm tired of waiting for something that I paid for 3 years ago under the belief that it was just a few months away. I have a 97 score currently, and I'm driving in rush hour in New Jersey so frankly 97 is surprisingly high. Am I ever going to see FSD? Tesla and Elon Musk are not reliable sources of information and it's impossible to figure out what's accurate these days. Is safety score calculation rounded? e.g. if their formula produces 99.5 or 99.6, does that round up to 100? Mine is 82.  I guess i wont ever get it if they keep it in beta forever I honestly think if you have a perfect 100 you are probably not a great driver. The metrics sound exactly like what people who block traffic flow and leave crashes in their rearview would drive lol I am super fine with them basing beta rollouts on safety score. However, I dont want to see them or anyone here talking about how much safer FSD is per mile compared to regular cars based on this data, as it will be a meaningless comparison.  Its already a somewhat meaningless comparison given that Tesla only reports safety data for when its engaged, which is only used primarily on highways, while comparing it to numbers from regular cars that includes both highway and city driving. (And city driving has a much higher accident rate than highway.)  But this added safety score selection bias will mean the comparison is even more meaningless. Im sure that wont stop the marketing people, though. Yeah mileage should definitely be a factor.  I did a bumper to bumper 7 hour trip (only 250 miles yay traffic) and got dinged a number of times for things out of my control.  Like dumbasses pulling out in front of me or  super late lane changes for construction (closing a lane.)  So I got dinged for following too closely and hard braking.  I'm still at 92, but it's going to be a while before I get it, even though I've driven 1000 miles in that two week period. The car is my impediment to a higher score - complete gibberish with the turn metrics and close following and then it freaks the fuck out on hilly turns and I get dinged for that.  Still at 94 though. Wasn't it supposed to be rolling 7 day score? My first couple of days are terrible but that was 10 days ago and it still counts. Damn. I'm 90. 89 gang rise up! Great. I should get it by 2025. What is this update for ? Nice delay tactic Elon. TIL that Tesla safety scores are a thing. Do they factor in the number of miles driven? Just score alone is odd. Are there REALLY a 1000 vehicles with PERFECT 100/100 scores.  No mater how carefully I drive, I always get dinged for something.  Too bad the app didn\'t link to TeslaCam to show you EXACTLY where you ""messed up"" I never even received the update to get a score ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry) What exactly is Friday midnight? Is this 10/08/22 00:00:01 or 10/09/22 00:00:01? Meaning Thursday to Friday night or Friday to Saturday night? Its always granny first, I never get to have something new first. Hope she goes to adult home soon. I\'d like to thank autopilot for giving me a terrible ""unsafe following"" score. I have the following distance set to 7 car lengths, but still the one long trip I took on a freeway, using NOA the entire time, ended with an unsafe following percentage of 38 percent. Now I have a 99 score and I guarantee will get this stupid feature sometime in 2059. Seems I'd have to do a 473mi road trip to nowhere in order to bump my score from 99 to 100.   It'd be insane to go and do that, right? Right? I hope Tesla values miles driven over the 1 mile and 100 score. It's the people with the lowest safety scores who should be given FSD. Well i guess i wont see 10.2 till another month or so, sigh :(  Safety score: 95 I would think people with the lowest score needs FSD more than people who can drive at 100 score. Bruh Elon, we gotta be perfect? You trolling me The beta isnt worth driving like a plaid like a wuss, dont care. So most people will not get into until spring/summer. Cool, really wish theyd just be honest. Would cut my frustration a lot. Does anyone know if you have to have a car in front of you when driving over 50 to effect the unsafe follow distance?  I ask because I got a 60% this morning, which dropped me to a 99 and is going to make it very hard to hit 100. Thing is I was in auto pilot for 99% of my drive over 50mph. It had to be during a merge or on ramp. I just drove about 20 miles on a back road over 50mph and got a perfect score, but it did nothing to offset the horrible score this morning. If I can knock that down this evening I can get back to 100 for the day and total. Ahhh, I'm at 99 and need 120 miles if additional driving to get over 180 miles of driving to get back to 100.  My daily commute is only 60.  How to convince wife i need to go on a 2 hour drive to nowhere?  Lol Got a 100 on 451 miles but 6 days of driving data I drove on autopilot at the speed limit 99% of the time and ended up with a 97.  Always on highway. Always on roads, except when making turns on public streets.  I'm going to be out of town until Monday anyway.   If I can wait this long, I can wait a couple more weeks :D.  Probably going to make me too nervous to use it all the time anyway. I got up to 99 after being at 98 for the first 7 days and UNFORTUNATELY I have to drive through Chicago during rush hour tomorrow!!!! SIGH!! So any accident data coming out of the FSD beta  will be meaningless given the ridiculously enriched sample. Ugh 728 mi for me to go Hold for several days in Elon time probably means months in normal time.   Im only at 98 and my wife is starting to get upset about not being able to drive the Tesla. Im not sure how much longer I can hold her off! Im convinced that I would have been driving less safe trying to get 100/100. Im 95/100. Ive had to brake for yellow lights, and other unexpected things that happen in real life. The people rocking 100/100 played a game and won. But its not about safety. Any tips to get from 98 to 100 by tomorrow? Lol With the Safety Score my wife gets I'll never get FSD. I wonder if this will be single stack? According to a calculator I need 100/100 for 450 miles to get my 98 to 100.  I'm definitely not sitting at a supercharger after driving 170 miles ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|laughing) Hold for several days   Who wants to place a bet it is WEEKS or even MONTHS? I wish it would give it to us based on driver profile.   Id have a ~99. My wife drops is to a 95. What does he mean by 100/100?  Is it over at least 100 miles? Just clicked back over to a 100. Now to get home and park until tonight! Managed to bring my 99 score up to 100 (used the handy calculator that was being passed around). Now I\'m just going to let my car sit pretty until tomorrow morning. I\'m still kind of skeptical that all people with ""perfect"" 100 safety scores will get it but I guess we\'ll see. Nobody still knows if a perfect 100/100 score means ALL drives have to a 100.  Or just the final score is 100.  We will know soon enough. Can someone that has 100 check their safety score in the app right now please? Mine is now saying Page failed to load. Try again. I reinstalled the Tesla app on both my iPhone and iPad. No avail. Thanks. Sooo anyone here in that batch of 1000? Is safey score not loading for anyone else? How are people doing the math to figure out how many miles they need to drive to raise their safety score? I'm at a 99 and literally trying to drive as much as I can to put myself over 100 before midnight. But I have no idea if I'm just wasting my time or putting an unnecessary amount of miles on my car for something that is completely unrealistic. Excited to see all videos of it over on r/tesla_fsd  Is there anyway to reset my safety score? 98 and still waiting. Thought us lowly 98s were getting it with 10.4. Another lie? Yes Im annoyed and getting impatient af. Might be different if the rules were applied to everybody the same, but clearly being a YouTuber allows you to circumvent the line. I guess my money is not as good. Anybody have knowledge on when alleged release to 98 will occur?",1930,"Anyone know what he means by 100/100? Have we got any info on the numbers of people who have boughten FSD? In other words, what is the size of the pool? My guess is it will be geo based and miles driven to get 100 Whats unfair is how many miles it takes to get your score back up to 100. Im at 98. Teslafi says I need to drive an additional 813 miles perfectly to get back up to 100. Mind you thats with only 200 miles driven since safety score was active. I was in ACC this afternoon and passed a parked car that was on the inside of a gradual right turn, which I would have passed with a 10 margin but it slammed the brakes so fucking hard I took it out of ACC. Fortunately there was nobody behind me. Checked my score and it went from my normal 99 trip score to 84 for that trip.  I find it hard to believe the Safety Score is based on anything other than who has big enough balls to let the automation handle everything 100% of the time Good thing I'm not enrolled in this. To stressful to maintain 100. 99 and below RIP I need one more drive to get back to 100. Time for a quick spin after work today. Fingers crossed no one does anything stupid in front of me. Lol what bullshit.  The safety score thing is nonsense, my apartment gate causes a FCW literally every time I go in or out so my scores like a 67 bc Ive had 102 FCWs since they started tracking.  If they ever try to lump that score into insurance premiums Im gonna go ballistic Lol sure Elon. 10 years from now maybe I somehow still have 100. AMA haha. Top 20 100%ers here! Cannot wait! (based on teslafi) Is there a minimum total distance you have to cover?  I am still working from home so all I've been doing is driving around town as needed.  1-8 miles per trip.  I sitting at 100 right now.  I probably drove 30- 40 miles since I hit the button.  I wonder if I'll get it. Im not sure how people get anything in the 90s. I go over the top of a hill I get forward collision where there is nothing there. I go through a roundabout 5 miles below posted i get hide speed turn penalties. Enjoy your beta.    I'm having a beer with the other awful people with scores below 100.  Cheers, frieds! Had 100/100 now 99/100. ...so the following week will be the next group of 100/100's?  I wonder how many drivers got that perfect score?  Those 99's could end up waiting for a vvverrryy long time... I was upset pst night and nailed my score to 82. Gulp. Son of a bitch.

Not that I think they should, just curious if they COULD. I believe the safety score and FSD  beta rollout delay came from 2 things:  1. The group decided to recode the whole thing for vision only. Maybe because of chip delay, maybe because Elon believes it's the only way. Maybe both. 2. When Elon originally announced the button the amount of feedback was far too great for the FSD team to comb through so they had to delay it while they created the programming and UI for the safety score so that they could actively monitor thousands of people autonomously. Cross a threshold and you do/don't get the beta. Easy to manage rather than manually pushing to every Joe that emails the FSD team about it. No hope for me at score of 91. This whole aggressive braking thing is stupid and childish. Opting out. Was at 99, then wife drove to the grocery store. Now at 97. Its just more BS from Elon and we all eat it up. Anyone daily driving their Tesla will not have a 100 score. I am an amazing driver with a near spotless driving record for 24 years and can not get my score above 98 because it is not a good system. My safe driving discount from State Farm doesnt even ding me that hard. No my guess this is going to go bad because the people with a 100 score are just driving it a little each day to get a 100. Then when they start driving there will be crashes and mistakes and Elon will suspend it. So you know good luck actually seeing the beta. When do they roll out a working basic cruise control? Note* Elon said perfect 100. Not everyone with 100s are perfect 100s many are rounded up 99.5555 etc   It may take weeks for us in the 99s or 98s. Something is WRONG with my forward camera.  Have reported this to Tesla 3 times.  Have even scheduled service to get it checked.  I\'m green on EVERYTHING but Forward Collision Warnings are KILLING me.  And no, I\'m not a worse driver than I think I am. Hear me out.  Something is seriously wrong.  For the first couple weeks I\'d get home after a VERY uneventful ""granny"" level drive, check my score and nearly drop my phone because of the FCW dings when NO FCW alerts sounded in the vehicle.  Then I read the detail about the scoring system which said that it measures FCW based on the ""medium"" setting, regardless of how your profile is set.  I checked mine and remembered I had set it to ""late"" a year or so ago because it was dinging so often.  Again, NOT because I am following too closely.  I generally keep 2 to 3 car lengths minimum, and have a pretty simple 5 mile surface street daily commute.  Here are some of the situations which caused me to change my FCW setting which before the driving score was just to quiet the frequent nuisance alerts, but which I now realize is a symptom of a bigger problem for my vehicle and which is KILLING my score.  **Example 1:** Someone merges OUT of the lane in front of me, FULLY INTO the turning lane.  If I\'m on autopilot, it slows down almost to a stop before passing them, usually to the point where I have to disengage autopilot to avoid unsafely slowing or even stopping in a wide open lane, and potentially getting rear ended.  These events also apparently trigger a FCW. And this even happens occasionally when coming up a hill on a right hand turn and someone is in the turning lane to the left of my wide open lane.  No danger at all, but Ding anyway.  **Example 2:**  Someone in front of me turns right, OUT of the lane, onto a side street or into a parking lot, again, if I\'m in autopilot, the car slows down almost to a stop before passing that vehicle which has FULLY exited my lane.  Generally I have to disengage AP.  And also, of course, it throws a FCW.  I mean, what the heck?  **Example 3:**  This happened just yesterday.  Going about 35, clear day, white car 2-3 car lengths in front of me. Red truck about 1 car length in front of that white car.  Red truck slows down abruptly.  My car impressively detects that slowdown, and presto...FCW.  Which...thanks, I guess?  But in actuality there was NO real risk.  We weren\'t going fast.  I had PLENTY of time. Didn\'t even have to tap the breaks. Just lifted off and let regen slow me down.  Didn\'t even interrupt the flow of traffic.  That\'s just called ""Traffic"".  But I still got dinged anyway.  Situations like that are WHY I set my FCW to ""late"" some time ago.  I was just tired being startled by an alert in instances where it was not relevant and there was NO real threat.  So now I\'m realizing something is apparently wrong, at least with my car.  I will go so far as to say there is basically NO way for anyone to drive MY vehicle in REGULAR daily city driving, and achieve any score close to 100.  Even if I leave 4 car lengths, someone will swerve in front of me to take that space, and I\'ll get dinged.  Huge Tesla fan, but really frustrated with the way this score thing is going for me.  Been waiting since 2017 for FSD.  You can BET I\'m driving VERY carefully.  But I\'ve got no chance as it stands now.  Hopefully they will find out what\'s wrong and fix it. Tesla so racist they paid $137 million to 1 person. Don't use autopilot if you want to get a perfect score. I trusted that autopilot would keep me within the prescribed limits but it turns out Tesla gives itself a pretty poor safety score. Surely the people with lower scores need more assistance? The 100 people have nailed driving and should keep doing it themselves. So the 10k I paid for a feature that I was supposed to get years ago was actually a lottery based on some system that Tesla designed! TIL Omg, you guys are obsessive. It's just a beta rollout for testing. You all suck at driving, some are just more lucky than others. Grow up. ""Driver score"" is nonsense conceived to allow Tesla to further delay the delivery of long-overdue promises.  None of the telemetry involved has anything to do with FSD. Why would the occasional ""hard turn"" or sudden brake (both of which are daily facts of life in urban driving and say NOTHING about the driver) be a factor when I switch over to full autopilot? Isn\'t FSD supposed to handle all of these aspects of driving when it\'s turned on?  The single factor that should matter most to Tesla, driver attentiveness, isn\'t measured at all. That tells you all you need to know.",54

Please cite evidence of exceptional ability in a few bullet points. Nothing else matters. According to Glassdoor, the average salary is about $155k for a senior engineer with 7-9 years experience, in San Francisco.          With the cost of living adjustment Id take a $6k paycut and probably have to work 50% more hours.         Pass. 155k GTFO. Thats  Glassdoor doesnt know how to deal with tech companies, Total compensation, and more senior roles. They keep emailing me to work on FSD. But from what I gather the work culture sucks, Id be taking a 60%+ paycut, and Id just generally be miserable.  (And yes, the Glassdoor numbers are probably a serious lowball - they always are. levels.fyi tends to be slightly better and is also uncompelling.)  Pass, no thanks. There is no shortage of engineering talent. There is a shortage of salaries at Tesla. Pay them more and I guarantee youll attract more good engineers. Tesla pays poorly compared to peer companies like Google, Facebook, Apple etc. it can be a stepping stone for a new AI engineer, but the best talent isnt at Tesla anymore By relocating to Texas, Tesla is basically stating they aren't interested in hiring smart women.

This somehow stings even though my calculator says I have 4713 miles to take my 97 to 100 Theyve unleashed the true boss/test in its final form  the weekend! /s  Joking aside, I wonder when theyll take the 100 snapshot now. Sucker Dad let his teen practice for road test. Score is down to 92. Ive abandoned all hope. RIP to all the Tesla owners who went for a 300 mile drive last night to pull up there score before midnight Uggh. Im supposed to drive again today. No way Ill be able to maintain my 100 score where Im going. At least FSD is reliable...in not working. Here's the real question. Sunday or Monday at 12:01 AM   OR  Monday or Tuesday at 12:01AM   Jk, who am I kidding. Elon doesn't even know. Lol Try this link, add your daily miles with the score for all the days you have and it will tell you how many miles you need to drive to have the desired score. Not even surprised. Theyve never stuck to a timeline before so why would they now. More disappointment.  If they were open and up front about this whole process for FSD owners then a small delay like this wouldnt be as irritating. you know the pressure on the dev team. they probably think they need another week but management says they need to have it done in the next 48 hours and they are all probably shaking their heads and their weekend is completely gone. Why are there so many likes on that tweet?!!! What a joke this guy needs to stop spouting dates Does anyone know if we have to drive everyday?  I managed to get a 100 and am considering just keeping the car parked in the garage over the weekend as to not screw anything up. I already have over 250 miles. (Last drove yesterday) Oh Elon.... Im fine with the delay. Wish they would say the safety scores are locked in. Driving on I4 in Florida everyday trying to maintain a 100 is anxiety inducing. Me sitting at 93 thinking I'm probably 3-4 months out at this point. Is FSD secretly a Fully Secure Driving project?   Convince people driving safely! This is pure speculation, but it's possible this actually has nothing to do with FSD itself.  I've heard from seems employees that their servers are having some big issues right now, and from what I can tell they're on going.  I'm not sure if the update servers are the same, or if they're also having issues, but many of their services are As I have said before, to appease those who have pre-paid for FSD, Tesla should allow 1 or 2 transfers for free of the FSD software. That would go a HUGE way in providing goodwill.  (Even if my next car is a Tesla, its not like Id ever pay for FSD again anyway.) I literally was thinking at about midnight last night I wonder who is going to have to call Elon and say - we cant release would you please tweet we are delayed? Then bam the tweet comes out a hour or so later. Lol, Im shocked  So, Elon stood us up again.  Yet, I'll still show up in 2,3,4...days.    I'm running out of outfits. Me: Extra time to study for the test!  Straight A students: annoyed OK.  I did a stupid.   I had a 100, figured ""What\'s the harm in driving 3 miles?""  Not 30 seconds after starting the drive I had to slam the brakes because someone was in my lane as I was taking a corner.  91 drive score, total is down to a 99.  Is that app still the beat way to figure out the number of miles I need to get back up to 100?  Even if the day hasn\'t finished? At least Elon said sorry this time. Lol. Look he can't do what he promised because YOU dont love him enough. I'm going to be winning so many bets right now. Lol I parked my M3 today since Im at 100 and we are going to Disney today and it isnt worth the risk.  Riding passenger while my wife drives our Traverse. Cant stop thinking about how bad of a safety score she would be getting right now. Pretty much the general level of care and communication I've come to expect from Tesla these days.  Disappointing, but I guess I'll keep the car parked for a couple more days until the deadline gets pushed back again. ***THANK YOU*** to all the Tesla employees working on the weekend for this.

Will there still be a nda? Ie will we actually know who gets it or will it be ""1000 were added but you\'ll never know due to the nda"". For all you know we let in 5 more. I'm very grateful to the Tesla employees who work long hours and weekends to make this happen.    Tesla Employees Rock! This was tweeted in the very early hours of Sunday, so maybe he actually means Monday night? Was really hoping I would wake up to it today lol. I have a drive from AR to Chicago today, and was planning on driving my Y Now, I guess Im making that 8 hour drive in our full size truck instead, so I can keep my 100. I am almost tempted to say screw it and drive the Y, but I just know the moment I enter Chicago, Im going to get dinged hard and bumped down.",13,"What a bad title.

Walked out to the garage to see it downloading  an update, version 2021.32.25! Hope that's it. Score is daily score or total average ?  Wasn't really care at first, but realized i got 100 int he recent couple days with over 100 miles ... But total average is 96... I got 100 total score yesterday at like 7pm central time. I'm probably over 1000 miles total. I haven't seen an update yet. I'm hoping I'm just being impatient and I wasn't too late. I have it and just drove at 4:00am in the Midwest. It feels like an aggressive 15 year old with his permit. There were times were I said Jesus Christ.... as it took a turn or got into a turn lane then hard braked. It missed two green lights and waited to turn right while it was green.   All and all, from watching the FSD Beta on yt I had higher expectations. What was once a relaxing drive to target with autolane keeping is now taking those same turns at full speed around corners and turning aggressively.   I will not be turning the beta on with my newborn in the car. Lol.   Its definitely overfit for CA and hasnt been trained on our Midwest roads for sure. Hoping my driving helps. Sent few snapshots too. Super excited about it overall still. Driving like a bunny with his grandma was worth it.   Sorry for the ramble. In a parking lot and just wanted my initial thoughts on paper.  Edit: looks like it doesnt understand our flashing yellow turn arrows. Hehe. The car did pretty good. Just took turns way harder than I would. Hit 100 at 7:30pm cdt Friday.  No update for me :(   have around 970 miles driven Confirmed already getting mine Over 300 milesstill waiting for the update in NJ  100, no update. Just completed first drive. Combination of manual drive and FSD. Confirmed Safety Score is still tracked for the manual drive parts. Perfect score over 100 miles as of last night, no update In the Midwest.  Pros:  took me to the local Kroger without intervention (5 mile route).  It handled the residential neighborhood like a champ stopping appropriately and turning gently.  It cautiously took an unprotected right with heavy cross traffic.  Cons: the second half of the turn was like a speed launch as others mentioned.    In all, these are things they are honing.  It really is exciting.  Be safe out there. Headed out in Maryland! Lets goooo.  As with all beta programs . Participate and send video :) Does anyone know yet if we get kicked out if/when our safety score goes below 100? So by the time it filters to us 95 weirdos, the cybertruck will be out.  At least it will be on brand :). Enjoy everybody. Again, unclear. Does this mean 100 miles since you were most recently 100, all miles in which you had 100 regardless of what your overall score was at the time, or the cumulative miles when you were 100? Now that it tries to navigate after the highway, I really need to be able to set like three or four different routes which can be hot-selected on the fly.  Like, the route it wants to take most days has the potential to drop me into a weird gridlock nightmare.  But the route I prefer is also prone to flooding.  Other times it will try to route around traffic which looks worse than it and take a big detour which has a bunch of awkward traffic lights.  For some reason, it also tries to route to the back entrance to the parking garage where charter busses usually sit in the morning, often blocking that entrance or making it difficult. I'm a machine learning engineer and damn, my experience has blown me away. Is it perfect? No. But the challenge they are up against is staggering. Excited to experience the progress along the way. This is the experience I paid for. Single stack yet WRT highway?  EDIT: FYI, after reading through the morning comments, it appears that's a NO. Has anyone received the update that achieved 100/100 score after Friday night? For those who have it - is it possible to initiate and/or cancel lane changes using the turn signals? Can you make it take a turn using the signals when you have no destination in Nav? So. I have a score of 99 and got the beta this morning!  No idea how/why but I'm going to go for the first drive now! I'm wondering if my 99 score with over 2000 miles will get me in this week I dropped my score to 99 couple days back but we received an email this morning that we will be getting fsd beta 10.2. Hmm. I will be playing with this a lot over the next several weeks obviously, but my very first experience with FSD was not confidence-inspiring. I only had it try to take me about a mile away, and there were more interventions and disengagements in that short trip than I can even remember. The most concerning of those were when 1) the car slammed on the brakes (thankfully at low speed), when, from all that I could tell, a pedestrian decided to cross the street *behind* my car, and 2) when I disengaged because the car was just about to plow right over a high curb / sidewalk in what it thought was the correct path to complete a right turn. I hit a deer last night on a dark country road and went from 98 to 94 for hard braking.    Impossible to avoid.  It jumped out from zero visibility to almost the same point as the car was already passing.  Lucky I could even slam the brakes. I hit 100 on Saturday, no update yet. &gt;500 mi. Its about what I thought it would be. Definitely need to be ready 100% of the time. It only tried to kill me once during my 11 mile Midwest test drive. Unprotected left at a light with oncoming traffic also trying to turn left and it drive straight toward them. Definitely too aggressive with turns. My impressions after a couple test drives this morning.     * Overall it\'s pretty good. It got me all the way from my house to the grocery store with zero interventions or mistakes.    * Turns felt natural and controlled, though it clips the apex a bit sharper than I do and that took a bit of getting used to.    * Pedestrians were respected, and right-of-way negotiations felt natural so-far, though I don\'t have too many data-points yet.    * A couple of hiccups in parking lots wanting to blast through empty slots once, and nearly veered into a wrong turn once.    * Biggest concern - a couple times it pulled out in front of a full-speed incoming vehicle with far less space than I\'d have liked. So little that I slammed on the accelerator otherwise I worry it would have forced them to slam on the brakes. This is something I know I\'ll need to keep an eye out for going forward.    * Couple turning mistakes - once it got into the ""straight lane"" when it was intending to turn left. I had to intervene and move it to the proper turn lane last second.    * It once started in the right-most left turn-lane and finished the maneuver in the left-most left turn-lane. Just downloaded mine! In CA So far, the update seems to have trouble with standard turns. Is there a way we are supposed to send feedback to Tesla when it makes an obvious error? To help train the software? Has anyone gotten the email but no pending update in the car? This world is so cruel *sob* Anyone on the East cost/Boston get the update yet? Can I just get a refund?  I want off of Elon's magic ride. I am kind of surprised that it cant even handle basic, divided but unmarked roads. FSD wants to treat the road like one huge lane, and drives in the center of it until it sees an oncoming car. Not really encouraging. Edit: Here is a picture my friend took that captures the screen and the centerline. Note that while this is clearly incorrect behavior, the car sometimes stays like this even when other oncoming cars are visible, or going into bends. So I tried FSD Beta out this morning, from the period before dawn into sunrise, so I experienced what it was like in darkness and with some sunlight. I drove in my local area to nearby grocery stores and McDonald\'s. Here\'s my observations:  * Darkness and early morning sunlight did not make a significant difference in my drive. * It handles neighborhood local driving very well. Turns a bit more quickly than I\'m used to, but it was safe and mostly smooth. I think FSD excels at slower speeds. * It handled a traffic circle like a champ, too. That impressed me, I was scared that might pose an issue. * Once it gets on faster roads, its turning speed is *really* aggressive for me, and I had to intervene a few times because I got nervous. Once, when making a protected left, I took control when it looked like it was about to turn into a car waiting at the stoplight. I think it would have made it, but it was way closer than I normally am comfortable with. * Lane changes are much smoother than with normal Autopilot. I really like this, I think this will make NoAP on the highway way less nerve wracking for me. * So is going through traffic lights. I had already gotten used to having to tap the accelerator or stalk to go on green, but now it\'s not necessary and it works great. * It can\'t handle complicated parking lots almost at all. This is where I had to intervene a lot, because even on driving lanes it was so ""jittery"" with pedestrians coming and going and cars stopping and starting. I\'m definitely going to be manual on parking lots for the time being. (It also confirms an observation I made long ago, that parking lots may be the most dangerous parts of the road, more than highways and local streets.)  Some tips that may help:  * If you have speed limit offset, turn it back to +0. Raise it only when traffic is a lot faster. This helps with the aggressive turns. * Don\'t get distracted too much by the new visualizations--they\'re really cool but in this beta you really want to keep your eyes on the road. This is where the eye tracker camera should be robust. * Those of us who got it now had 100 safety scores, and are probably careful drivers by nature. FSD is going to seem a lot more ""careless"" than you might be used to. Don\'t be too afraid to intervene but it\'s important to trust the system just a little bit. It does work in the main.  Overall, I am very impressed. There are obvious limitations, but I\'m confident they will be overcome in due time, and I\'m going to try a longer/commute-length driver on the highway later this week. Will report when that happens. Had 100/100 on Friday, 99.9 score (one low mile 98 on the first day) with 800 miles driven since the button went live, and still nothing. Anyone from NV get the download yet? I got 100 score but didnt drive 100 miles so I didnt get in :( I don't even see the button to sign up for safety score stuff in my 2019 Model X. Is it Model 3 only? Laughs with score 89(I gave up trying after going from 99 to 95 stuck in an hour of traffic) Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, contractions, and other phrases which expand to something larger, that I\'ve seen in this thread:  |Fewer Letters|More Letters| |-------|---------|---| |[AP](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hgz36xv ""Last usage"")|AutoPilot (semi-autonomous vehicle control)| |[AP2](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hgbg1k3 ""Last usage"")|AutoPilot v2, ""Enhanced Autopilot"" full autonomy (in cars built after 2016-10-19) [in development]| |[DC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hg8pxwd ""Last usage"")|Direct Current| |[FSD](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hgvls7y ""Last usage"")|Fully Self/Autonomous Driving, see AP2| |[HW3](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hgaphfv ""Last usage"")|Vehicle hardware capable of supporting AutoPilot v2 (Enhanced AutoPilot, full autonomy)| |[LR](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hgaiw7s ""Last usage"")|Long Range (in regard to Model 3)| |[M3](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hgawi90 ""Last usage"")|BMW performance sedan| |[RWD](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hgaiw7s ""Last usage"")|Rear-Wheel Drive| |[S75](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hg8wfvu ""Last usage"")|Model S, 75kWh battery| |[S75D](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hg91dlm ""Last usage"")|Model S, 75kWh battery, dual motors| |[SEC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hg9oevq ""Last usage"")|Securities and Exchange Commission| |[TACC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hgd7wgp ""Last usage"")|Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (see AP)| |[TMC](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hgbg1k3 ""Last usage"")|[Tesla Motors Club forum](| |[TSLA](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q5r99i/stub/hg8rj15 ""Last usage"")|Stock ticker for Tesla Motors|  ---------------- ^(14 acronyms in this thread; )[^(the most compressed thread commented on today)](/r/TeslaMotors/comments/q8ovdc)^( has 28 acronyms.)   ^([Thread #7277 for this sub, first seen 11th Oct 2021, 15:38])  ^[[FAQ]]( [^([Full list])]( [^[Contact]]( [^([Source code])]( I wonder when anybody who gets to 100 score or crosses 100 miles AFTER this last Friday night will get it. Not until the next wave with the 99 score people? Or sooner? Im at 100 score, but just crossed 100 miles this morning. Those that got it, when did your get the 100 score? Did any get up to 100 after Friday? Will I get to try it with my 90 safety score? Any news on MCU1 owners with FSD? Has anyone gotten in this recent FSD Beta with an AP 2.5 car (without cabin camera)? Im just curious how its working for us as far as being eligible to get it. Count down to someone claiming FSD caused their crash only for it to be revealed they aren't in the program. Anyone with a 2017/8 MS75x gotten the software? Wondering if Ive not gotten it due to the era of car (MS75 w/ AP3 &amp; MCU2), even though Ive had 100/100 safety score for quite a while.   Seems that mostly its been newer cars that got prioritized in getting the software pushed to them? Cross-posting my first FSD experience from earlier this morning.  Just did my first test drive!   It\'s not perfect; no one was expecting it to be. But it\'s really amazing.   That first unprotected left had my nerves bubbling, but the car executed it perfectly, gave right-of-way appropriately. Some sketchy behavior with a couple of speed bumps. The first one it handled great, but the second it came in too hot, and I had to disengage. It also handled a ""roundabout"" (quotes because it\'s just a decorational one on a neighborhood street) a bit slower than I or other human drivers would.   Minor complaints/observations. All-in-all, it was pretty remarkable to experience. Got a roadtrip this weekend. Some highways, but largely state routes that don\'t normally work with Navigate on AP. I\'m excited to see how it does! Whew boy it feels like driving at age 15 all over again. Only thing missing is my mother yelling at me from the passenger seat. I cant wait to watch it progress even more.   I thought the fsd visualization area became much larger when active? That area size hasnt changed to overtake most of the screen like seen in previous beta videos. Anybody in the NYC area who received the update? Genuinely curious since the traffic within the city is quite ""challenging"" and want to know how it would perform. I am curious as to how 10.2 handles evolving traffic conditions. Any word on if this is just for people who bought FSD outright or are people with the monthly subscription included? Such a bad metric; they should have smoothed it out and weighted it by miles. I have a 98 over almost 2,000 miles with multiple drives of 200 miles or more with 100 scores. This is an awfully stupid game with inadequate measurements by the car that cost thousands of dollars. A million robotaxis here we come! The turning is aggressive but the biggest issue I had was with driving on residential streets without lane dividers. I went through an area that has wide lanes with more than enough room for 2 vehicles to pass each other in opposite directions and where human drivers would stay on their side of the road...FSD chose to drive right down the center of the road.   I had 2 oncoming cars that I drove by. The first I took over because it felt like I was playing chicken with the other driver and didn't want to freak them out. The second vehicle I let it go longer to see what FSD would do and it did eventually move more to the right side of the road but waaaaay later than I would normally do it.  It seems unmarked residential streets in general are still a little bit of a issue. Turning into streets that don't have lane markings, it wants to turn to the center of the road when thats not normal/expected behavior.  Overall impressed so far with my limited FSD driving. Over 2400 miles and a Safety Score of 100.  No beta for me.  EDIT: [Screenshot from TeslaFi]( after my round trip for work today. I wonder if it is retroactive. Like if you have 100 score but not enough miles right now, and they start rolling out to 99's, will you get automatically added if you get 100 miles. I found the FSD feels like a brand new student driver that is sometimes confident but other times very hesitant and unsure. It can make mistakes and needs it's driver training teacher to take over if the mistake is serious.  But it jumps into turns like a professional movie stunt driver showing off. Did anyone without the in cabin camera get it Installed FSD Beta this morning and took my Model Y on a few short drives (I am in a Chicago suburb). A few notes and comments:  * Overall very impressed as it handled driving through neighborhoods with ease. * Turning at times was a bit faster than I would normally drive, but it got the job done. * Only had to correct it twice - once was a tricky intersection where there was a two options to turn left (one was very sharp), and the car took the wrong option.  The second correction was some confusion over two lanes merging into one and it lost confidence on the lane markers. * It did a great job changing lanes in somewhat challenging traffic with commuters. * For some reason it every so often slowed down without any explanation with no other cars or people around. * We got passed a few times because we were going the speed limit and other cars lost their patience going 25 MPH. * At a train crossing it stopped well ahead of the painted train crossing lines on the road.  I am not sure this is a mistake or purposeful to stay well away from the crossing. * This is the future for sure - congrats to Musk and Tesla.  Really incredible. Will those who achieve a 100 score be automatically given the Beta? Say I hit 100 in a few days, am I in? Imagine buying something then the seller tells you they don't think you deserve to have it and refuses to give it to you.        Unreal. I had 100/100 as of Friday and through the weekend but I still didn't get the Beta. Are they slowly rolling it out or did I just draw the short straw? \\~175 miles driven also. I feel bad for the people who have to drive 101 miles when will us untouchable get it? Currently at 97, could maybe hit 98 soon. Or not. Anyone in NYC/north jersey get the beta yet? Curious how it's handling these road conditions Good news everybody, I've increased my score from 89 to 90 over the weekend Anyone else who had 100/100 and not get into the beta now also unable to see their safety score on the app?  Did I just get unenrolled from the program?  Closed and reopened the app, logged out and back in, nothing. Car still says Im in \\*""rolling out to SOME cars with 100/100..."" I've had my car since late 2016, and have waited for FSD since then.  I've had to continually correct for Tesla's desire to kill me on freeways from the early days.  Thankfully, the Tesla programming has improved much over those last 5 years.  What you lucky 100%'rs are describing are what I experienced 5 years ago.  I'd like to have Tesla allow me to push a button so I can get a refund on the FSD I paid 5 years ago... I can't go through that period, all over again! Do we think that some major metropolitan areas are excluded? Like NYC???   I want to test FSD in NYC... California Drivers, score 90-98, eta Q2 of 2022 at the rate of 1K beta releases per week. 100 score,  800 miles. Got nothing.  I said to myself last night,  its not going to happen nothing good ever happens to me . And you know what I was right. Went for a drive in my partners car, who got FSD this morning. Wish I had it recorded, but the nice version is that it was really, really bad. I can see places where it would be acceptable, but all of my local roads are apparently totally new territory for FSD beta. Didn't slow down for a single speed bump, the boost out of corners is actually terrifying, it doesn't handle poor road markings or having intermittent median structures (almost drove into several of them), unprotected lefts are bad just in general, tried to turn left into incoming traffic on one of the turns. Just a generally extremely stressful experience. I was very diligent to make sure we are reporting everything.  Do not treat this software lightly. Something that the FSD beta testers don't mention that I found particularly uncomfortable is the speed and randomness with which the car will turn the wheel. It's extremely violent and often times unexpected. Keep a very firm grip on the wheel, because this can really get you into trouble very fast. Just outside 128 and got the update this morning.   Email came at 3:00 am.   I was at 100 on Friday night but got knocked down to a 99 on a Saturday road trip (heavy braking). Im glad I got 100/100, because after using this I cant see it rolling out much further for a while. Its fun, and very cool, but also unpredictable. So why does the mini photo of this thread look like a dong? Thanks Reddit app Im 99/100 what the heck Ive got over 300 miles of 100 driving, but I dont have a 100/100 overall. Its a 99. Since last week its all been 100. But I had one false FCW and one emergency braking event where I hit the brakes because of an idiot pulling out in front of me and thats kept me at 99/100. I do burnouts and drift in my M3, I'm guessing I don't have a 100 safety score? Safety Score is no longer showing for my car that got FSD beta. However it still shows for my other car that didnt get FSD beta. Anyone else lose their safety score? Currently watching a video of 10.2 almost plowing into a bunch of construction signs. 100/100 since rollout started - no email, no update.  WTH? Any idea when they might start the next roll out to people with sub 100 scores? The Unsafe following even while on autopilot or smart cruise is killing my score. Im in the low 80s. Guess Ill have to wait til next year  I got the 10.2 being pushed to your car email Sunday night but still havent received an update. Anyone else experience this? What do I do? Is there a way to force check for the FSD Beta update? I just got to 100 miles with a 100 safety score early this afternoon.",1515,"Anyone from Canada get access to the beta yet? 100 miles?! Talk about moving the goalposts   Irrespective of whether the original or the updated policy is a better policy, this is a change from the policy previously announced by Musk on Twitter Delays followed by changing the requirements again?!?  I remember back when pushing the button was supposed to download the beta as soon as youre connected to WiFi. So fucking stupid. Give me what i paid for So for the rest of us who have zero desire for FSD or beta testing, can we please TURN OFF VISUALIZATIONS?  Why not put that in a similar update for us?

Drives 1 block:  ""What do you think so far?"" Nice first drive but not need to rub in the ""perfect 100"". The more Im glad all you 100 scoring test pilots have fun, and get the bugs out for the we, the unwashed. Momma bear seems pretty skeptical, lol I really dig when the visualization zooms out at the intersections. Really gives you the confidence that the car ""sees"" everything clearly. I did my first drive today on FSD beta. It's impressive and terrifying at the same time. Like letting the ghost of a teenager drive.

If something like that does come around, then, yeah, why wouldnt I want to go back [to space]?  Sounds like Jared already planning next mission - perhaps a little farther on Starship... As a SpaceX fan who didn\'t follow Inspiration4 closely (because other than the Dragon Cupola and ""first civilian mission"" title, it bores me), this was a great interview! This interview answered one of my questions about the ability to reorient the craft (changing view from cupola):  &gt; &gt; Since you were trained to fly Dragon, did you ever take control and fly or reorient the spacecraft? &gt;  &gt; It was one of my regrets, not changing the pointing mode. We have a Sun+GEO mode and its better communication, but **it points the cupola towards the star field**. And I dont know why none of us really thought about it, but we didnt.  I was really curious to see if there was an awesome view to the stars in the show, was disappointed they didn't even mention changing the view. Cool to hear that it's possible. I binged this on Netflx on Monday and I kind of expected it just to be some lucky joy ride with some more insight on the Dragon spacecraft's interior. Turns out that it was quite touching and inspiring (for me at least). I specifically found Hayley's in-orbit zoom call with kid cancer patients quite moving - answering all the questions they may have about space.   My main criticism with the mission and docu-series, however, is all the exclusivity with Time Studios and Netflix. I get this is a commercial flight and they can do whatever they want, but I think the mission's stated goal would have been better served if it was open and free to the public. In other words, I wish more people could watch the series and be inspired about Space without needing a Netflix account.  I definitely hope Jared is planning more ambitious missions. It seem like this one was very well executed. Wow that's amazing he pretty much answered everything I was always wondering. &gt; Hayley, she had no problem at all. She just loved it.  i'm starting to suspect that the operation at st jude involved a little more than just removing a tumor. is it possible that all her bones were replaced by adamantium, and perhaps some superhealing mutations were also introduced? Hey, I was curious, can someone answer how far they travelled during their journey?  I put it up on /r/theydidthemath, but nobody has responded thus far. &gt; If you cant separate from the second stage, thats an immediate come home because you jettison the trunk   Wow, the Zuma failure (sort of). I'm pretty sure nothing like that has ever happened with astronauts, but its really interesting to see its considered... with an escape route.     &gt; and thats a manual re-target back, because theres not enough time for ground [control] to upload a burn to get you back to a supported site.  surprising the cases are not already loaded in the computer, even to the extent of selecting available coastal sites as in the movie *Gravity* (this crew is somewhat more professional though;). &gt;It was one of my regrets, not changing the pointing mode. We have a Sun+GEO mode and its better communication, but it points the cupola towards the star field. And I dont know why none of us really thought about it, but we didnt.   That was one of my questions during the mission, and I can't believe they didn't do it! Pointing the cupola away from earth while the sun is behind earth would've have been better than looking at earth!  Looks like Jared has a his excuse for a second trip. &gt; Coming downhill is nothing like the movies where everybody's sweating and there's condensation everywhere and there's a fireball out the window.  Lol i know who watched Apollo 13, the movie, before going up. and tbf to that film, it *was* broadly true that there was a lot of condensation there, altho only because they had frozen and then reheated the CM, nothing to do with re-entry I think Jared was a fantastic commander and I hope hes able to go up on future missions again, and help really push us further than before (maybe a starship mission to the moon?).

Commence driving school mode. Do we have confirmation on what ""99"" means. - A 98.5 shows as a 99 in the app. Is that enough? Finally those of us who got to 100 on Saturday will get our shot! Heres hoping the refreshed Model S is included too. Thats a lot of people. I wonder if I can hit 100 with my all autopilot drive to Austin next week? Cries in 98. Does anyone know if this will include people with 100/100 but didn't meet the cutoff? Or should I purposely bring my score down to a 99.  A bit worried this query will be run:  SELECT \\* FROM TABLE USERS WHERE safety\\_score = 99 Do we think it's anyone with 99.0 and up or people with rounded scores up to 99 as well? Aaaaaaand I'm 50 miles from 100 with a 99.46. At least I'll have some breathing room. I'll believe it when I see it. I thought about doing crazy amounts of driving to try to get to 99 (from 97).  But it's all just driving for beta, I'm working from home and have nowhere to go right now.  Who knows, maybe I can push a bit and get to 98.  I assume it's an average based on total mileage?  Like the further I go, the further I'll need to go to bring it up?  Or is it some sliding window thing? Oh man its be awesome if the 100/100 got it this weekend that missed it last weekend. Huge if true. But you need 1000 miles this time... I wonder what surprise we get this time. Perfect. Just in time for my car to go into service center.  I'm fluctuating between 96 and 97. I need to clean up my act or I might be looking at getting into the beta around Thanksgiving at the current pace. Now I need to go from 100 to 99 Ill wait another couple months and re-up the FSD subscription when this is available for everyone, not just people who are forced to not have fun with their car for a score. Where can I find my score? I dont see it in the app. Is it only for folks with FSD? I just want to get an update that allows me to see my driving score. Still nothing after owning the car for about a month. Is there anyone who sees a score without having pressed The Button?  The info from Tesla suggests thats not necessary, but I *still* dont see the score after trying all combinations of reinstalling, logging out &amp; in, plus 2 different app upgrades (iOS). I'm currently at 96 and I would need to drive 2,000 miles to get to 99..... yeah i dont think thats gonna happen. Just got an email for inviting me to beta. 100 score from last Friday night. Just got my fsd email so they must be pushing to people with 100 after the cutoff last week. Was 99 on Friday and 100 Saturday night Just got FSD email. Downloading now! 100/100 score since last Sunday but didnt make it into the initial wave. Apparently a follow up release for 100ers. Yay! Just got my email and update! Turns out they are rolling it out each night to however many vehicles! Got the email and downloading 10.2 now! I'm glad I pushed it to 100 from my 99. Wondering if this will include model s and x? 100s just got the update (10.2 not 10.3 of course) tonight if you  didn't get it before. (for supported cars) If someone goes from 99 to 100, would they automatically be eligible for it right now? If anyone knows the answer to this x.x I've replied to a few post with this information, but figured id do a top post to try to help everyone understand how to raise your Total score starting today, as it seems a lot of people think they need to focus on saftey factors... which is the wrong move. Miles with a 100 score is key from here on out. There also seems to be some confusion on if AP can help your score or not, so want to cover that too -  have a tl;dr 3 bullets at the end  hopefully this helps at least a few people understand the system better   There are two scores we care about ==========================   * **Daily Score:** This score is _only_ affected by the 5 safety factors. FCW, Hard Breaking, Aggressive turning, Unsafe following distance, and forced autopilot disengagement.   * **Total Score:** The score you care about most. This is the main score in the app, and the one you want high to get into the beta. This score is _only_ affected by your Daily Scores weighted by miles driven on each score.    ----------------------------    TL;DR Only way to raise your score now, is to get high daily scores (ideally 100) with a lot of miles driven at that score. **You dont need to go trying to fix one of your overall safety factors, it wont do anything**   **What about autopilot**  ================  AP imo is the best thing possible to help raise your Total Score, lets explain how it actually works for each score type.   **Autopilot and the Daily Score**  ===============  As stated above, the only thing that matters for your daily score are each of the safety factors. While on AP, Anything it does bad will not hurt any of those factors. AP can hard brake, it can get FCW off a hill, and your score will not be hurt However, it's also not increasing the daily score, which can make things tricky - here is an example:  - Lets say you only have a single turn, and one light before you get to the highway and turn on AP.  However, the only time you used your brakes while _you_ were driving, you got dinged for hard braking, then you are going to have near max hard braking score affecting you ( because 100% of the braking you did, was hard braking) , as AP will not lower that / count in the calculations for braking.  You could end up with a super low score, and a lot of miles added to that weight, yikes  However, if you were able to get to the highway with a 100, Activate that AP! You want those miles for your Total score, and youll no longer be dinged for someone cutting you off.   -----------------------------  TL;DR - AP will not raise or lower your daily score. Make sure if you are using AP, that your score for the day was high before turning it on. You dont want to add a lot of miles to a low score. If your score is low, stop using AP for that day. You need to manually drive to improve your safety factors (aka your daily score)   **Autopilot and your Total Score** ===============================  Yes, all miles driven on AP get calculated into the weighted score. So driving long trips on AP are ideal for raising your total score (as long as the daily score for that day is high). A quote from teslas safety score website:  &gt;Your daily Safety Score is not impacted by the number of miles or hours you drive. We combine your daily Safety Scores (up to 30 days) into a **mileage-weighted average** to calculate the aggregated Safety Score, which is displayed on the main Safety Score screen of the Tesla app.   ----------------------  TL;DR AP good if your daily score is good. Turn off AP if you need to raise your daily score.   **If you have a bad score, make sure to do what you need to fix it _THAT_ day** ==================   Once the day is over, that score is your score. If you get a 10% on hard braking on day A, it is to late to go and try to brake a lot on day B, that will do nothing for your total score. At that point, you can only lower the weight of that bad score by getting a lot of miles on better daily scores   **Best way to improve Hard braking**    Your hard brake score is based of the % of time you are braking, without braking to hard. AP does not help with this (AP will also not hurt this is it hard brakes)  As long as it is the same day as the hard brake. Go somewhere safe, where you can get a little speed, then let regenerative braking brake for you. Never use your brake pedal itself, Also dont fully let your foot of the accelerator. Look at the graphic of your car on the screen, the lights on the brakes will light up once you are slowing down fast enough for the car to consider it braking.        **Best way to improve unsafe following**   This is another one where it calculates it off a % of the time you are close enough to another car, without being to close.. The trick here is, you need to be going over 50 mph, and being on AP will not help you.  You will need to hit the highway and find another car you can get a safe distance from **(there has to be a car in front of you)** and go over 50 mph.  Once again, this is for the daily score. No point in doing this if you have a perfect follow score for the day  ----------------------------------   * You can read about the calculations here:   * public spreadsheet i found on this reddit that I use (not mine):    * Tool version of the sheet above:    ----------------------------   **Ultimate tl;dr**  * Dont bother trying to fix overall safety factor such as hard braking for your **total score**. it has no impact on your total score  * You want 100's with lots of miles -&gt; us AP to get those miles  * If your **DAILY score** for the day is low, turn off AP, you need to drive by hand to get that score up / fix safety factors. At 97 on the verge of 98. Think I can swing it. The reset after FCW has saved my ass several times and kept me in the game. Anyone got a link to that calculator? Where can you check your safety score? I raised my score to 100/100 over the weekend after the initial cut off and I was pushed the beta this morning! I have got the eMail!  Score is 100 which I achieved on Tuesday. My car just got the update (100/100). So I had a 100 score but only 10-20 miles driven, didnt get FSD in the launch last week.   I had to take a road trip yesterday and logged an additional 200 miles and kept the 100.  Got the email last night that I got FSD beta. Interesting. So following this release schedule me and my 95 score might, maybe see a beta in 10 weeks or so.  I think I still want my money back.  :) At a 96, wonder if I can pull those numbers by then lol For the benefit of some of us...now might be a good time to ask Elon if there is a score that will never get the beta.   I have a feeling I am closer to the ""floor"" score than getting the beta. Meanwhile I'm having to drive my Skoda to a dealership to receive a software update ... LOL Anyone else get the email beta and update the software and then their car finish updating and still not have the beta? Just finished the update and went to the car and I have no option in autopilot to enable it. The button to request it is still there. I'm at a 94, two days have 100+ collision warnings on 8 miles driven. I don't think there's any fixing the glitches from AP. 97. Twice from phantom forward collision warnings. Not happy. Does this mean no 10.3 this Friday for normal people?

Logged out / in but still not seeing it (Laughs in 88 Safety Score) Can you elaborate on ""Unsafe follow distance"", I can\'t wrap my head around how on a 100 mile trip I scored 50% despite being in AP at all times, at a follow distance of 5. Only thing I can think of is when I disengaged AP when a semi cut in front and I didn\'t believe AP was going to handle it safely, and since I only drove that 500ft, the 250ft of it where I was backing off was considered unsafe following...that kind of thing would piss me off if my insurance rate were in jeopardy due to a programming shortfall.  My score sits at a 98, but it still irks me that I am averaging 26% unsafe following when I am extremely conscious of my follow distance, especially at speeds above 45mph. Sadly as much as we try been next to impossible to get above a 97~99 daily in NYC. Is it actually all cars? Or are cars with yoke and AP2 cars still excluded from beta? 600 miles driven with a 99. One single trip to the grocery store with two phantom FCWs and now I need to drive &gt;1,000 miles to get back to 99. This sucks. I guess we dont know if this means there will be a step update this weekend to 10.2.1 or something?  or just nothing at all until 10.3 Ok, looks like I have a week to get hard breaking 0.6-&gt;0.4 and FCW from 1.9-&gt;1.7! Penis silhouette 4 false positives on FCW... nothing even on the roadway in front of me...  I'm not getting it anytime soon.  I've got a 97 score and have travelled over 1,000 miles since my last FCW (by avoiding the road where I got the false positives)  Not sure how the FCW score is calculated either since one scored a 40, another scored a 75, one a 26, and one an 18...  Does it have to do with miles in that particular trip? Those of us who were the first purchasers of FSD in 2016-2017 (HW2.0 later upgraded to HW3 FSD Computer) are now the only group excluded from FSD Beta. Remember when Elon heaped praise on those of us who bought Teslas when the companys future was in serious doubt? Me too. So much for gratitude. Somebody owes me $10 Well, I have 7 days to get my 99 ruined to a 98! So if Im at 98 and can get to 99 by Friday, would I be included our is it just looked at last weeks finalized score? Hopefully this isn't adding bias to their training data in a way that doesn't work as well for your average driver. At this rate of progression I'll have FSD by early November... 2022 I swear if it turns out this was one of you 100 safety score beta testers ruining it for us 99ers Im going to be pissed. curious for any of the 100 score people that got in initially, did the scoring section of the app remove itself or do you still see yours?  &amp;#x200B;  Mine oddly turned off and I do not have the score section anymore.  Am I alone on that? Does anyone else feel the forward collision warning is too sensitive? I currently have a score of 96. It is a struggle because it is nearly impossible to drive on the highway here in northern NJ without getting dinged for following too closely.  I try to quickly switch to AP once I am over 50 mph and cant maintain a adequate distance. To exacerbate the issue, my wife drives the car and doesnt use AP. She also seems to get a FCW almost every time she drives. So after every time she drives, I have to go out and un-do all the damage she did. We do have a second car but neither one of us likes to drive it any longer.   Next week she needs to go into NYC. Meanwhile I am struggling to maintain mid 90s so I at least have a chance to get beta sometime this year. So my question is, do I let her take the car to New York and if the answer to that is no, which if you will tell her shes not allowed to drive it? Has anyone received the beta after getting to 100 in the same day? I wish I knew the diluting trick early on, I would easily be on 100.  Trick is to fix your negative scores the day they occur. Quicker to dilute rather than driving a lot of miles for a number of days. I read somewhere that you could cancel a problematic drive by rebooting before going into park. I discovered earlier tonight that its more than that: I drove about 5o feet from my house, rebooted, then continued to drive for 80 miles before parking the car. I got NO safety score at all for the entire drive. So: wanna do some donuts? Wanna try some drifting? Wanna do a track day? Just make sure you reboot somewhere during the drive, and youre golden. OMFG. Still at 99, after 1 day with a 77, every subsequent drive with a score of 100. Why on earth did I pay all that money for this silly thing? so is this 12am friday or 12am saturday? so is it today?? So is today the day?  Been sitting at 99/100 since day 3 of the queueing and ready to start testing! I guess this is still on track? Brought my 98 to a 99 this morning lol. Hopefully I can get in. Welp My score would have gone to 100 tomorrow, just by virtue of my poor first day falling off of the record (all 100s since then), but I got the 10.3 release last night, with my score still at 99. About to go out and try it for the first time, in our first big storm in quite a while.",674,"So we are waiting another week? Or are we getting the update today? How many miles to you need to drive to register? If I just drive a few minutes a day, will that count? I live on a gravel road, where my car thinks, oh he's going off the road (with no lines), corrective steering applied, even though it's useless and dangerous, does that doc my score? How does one go about obtaining a safety score, I do not see that in my Tesla app.  Must you be a subscriber of FSD first? Do you need to have ordered FSD to receive update 2021.22? We're still on .21 To. The. Moon. Well I guess I'm doing the 410 miles of perfect driving to get to 99 by next week.  I hope the safety score and those who made it burn in hell... Wow something I already paid thousands of dollars for I might have a chance at using!!! FSD sucks anyway, gotta tap the camera icon all the time im at 98 miles. 100 score. I cant get myself to justify going in and driving 2 miles. what do i do Cant stand FSD on the freeway, seems like if I even glance at notifications its AP jail for me.",12

Like the steering wheel? Is there a photo of it? Its legal to drive without them? So kinda like the Jeep Wrangler I'm legally required to have front license plate but havent been pulled over for not having one ever.... rEGulatOrs hate tHIS One wEird trick As a European: I see EV's like the Honda E, Audis and even semis being delivered and being driven legally with just cameras instead of side mirrors. Why is this not possible in the US? Texas only requires one mirror. The rear view mirror is sufficient. I'm not certain about driving to neighboring states. The regulators really really really need to get with the times and allow for virtual (camera based) mirrors. Americans dont use their mirrors anyway or their turn signals. God bless this man and the engineers making it happen.   A while back, I wanted to swap out out regular mirrors for tow mirrors on a Ford pickup, and it would have required prying off the door panels, removing the dashboard, splicing wires, changing switch panels, and paying a dealer to flash the car's computer. If you remove the mirrors is there still a camera/screen?  As a life-long pickup truck driver I can't drive without side mirrors. I don't really care if I get .5% better range, I would never remove the side mirrors. I just want to know what tools I should bring on the day of pick up. Ive had a LR Defender with a digital rear view mirror. It sounds great in theory, but absolutely terrible in practice. Theres always a tiny delay in the video feed, which could be crucial when making maneuvering decisions, the image is too grainy in low light, the LCD backlight is annoying at night time (OLED mirrors could fix this issue, but OLED screens of that size are expensive to manufacture).    The worst part however is the fact that you have to completely change your eyes focus  to look at the screen. Your focal distance when driving is a at minimum a car ahead, and when switching to something thats at arms length, your eyes take a split second to adjust. This isnt an issue with regular mirrors as you are focusing on an optical reflection of a roughly the same distance as looking forward.   Another issue is that you cant peek to the side to see more or check a blind spot. The wide angle of the camera partially makes up for that, but its an entire new habit to learn.   TLDR: try getting dressed/hair/makeup on an iPad instead of a mirror, youll probably give up pretty quickly for all the same reasons.  Edit: forgot to mention that you also cant accurately gauge distance of objects when looking at a screen. Meanwhile, tomorrow at Tesla headquarters, some poor engineer is about to find out his week just got a lot busier redesigning the doors and mirrors because of this tweet. I'm curious whether they look Cyberpunk'ish. Love it. Some people need to look before they change lanes, looking in the side mirrors arent it. The fact my cameras randomly went out for a few days on my less than a year old M3 doesn't make me super confident about all this mirrorless talk. The mirrors will be attached with magnets.

I would love to understand more about such a regression and how it is fixed in a **single** day, b/c clearly my current understanding of how Tesla develops AP is incorrect.  Not being snarky  I just legit dont understand how they train the NNs, etc. and then bang out a 1 day fix (?) need to hold 99/100 overnight then Who put Missy Cumming in charge of programming left turns this week? Nice . I got to 99 yesterday morning after being stuck in 97 for weeks . Started with a 91 day 1 lol . I found out about the tricks  people use to improve their score / reset late but its fine . 99 with 1.5k+ miles in Atlanta is an achievement Im proud of. Cant wait to stop driving like a grandmas though . It pisses people off a lot So close...!  I have been hanging at 99 since I figured out how the scoring actually works.   I just recalculated and I would still take 1800 miles to get to 100. Well, shit.  I have to drop by car off tomorrow to have some body damage repaired on Monday. they must be describing how in 10.2 it tried to cut hard right into a car on a left turn at a light, double lane  &amp;#x200B;  that was present in 10.2 and somehow worse in 10.3   uh oh haha  &amp;#x200B;  anyway good luck team we know it isn't easy but you are doing great work! Just got mine back to 100 last night, after being stuck at 99 for so long.  Just in time to hit the 99/100 group, and now delayed a little more. Haha  Update: Got an email from Tesla about FSD Beta, and installing now. As I let my wife take the car out today =|  Only a few miles though and I have around 1500 Hopefully this prevents the car from sitting at the light. Sometimes it wont go without throttle input. Couldve tweeted that out at any point Friday.. PR Person is not doing a good job. This is probably due to that one where it completely cuts off a Prius for a left turn. Im sure Teslas engineers are loving all this entirely unnecessary, tweet-driven, unpaid weekend overtime.  If Tesla wants to hire and retain the best and brightest it needs to stop doing this. The world will survive to fix it during working hours. I still haven't gotten 10.2 yet - did that ever go into broad release to the FSD Beta participants? Oh man, dilute the hell out of those dings in a neighborhood! Off topic but I didn't want to create a post to ask a question....

This is just the reality of driving here. FSD sits in the left turn lane, consistently foregoing its small window of opportunity to actually safely complete the maneuver. When it does find a break in traffic, it oftentimes behaves as if all streets are one lane only and attempts to turn either into an oncoming traffic lane or a median and then corrects at last minute.  Left turns are pretty cringey right now, at least in a city with traffic and more than one lane. This sucks. I'm sitting at a 99 right now (98.51 to be exact). I got a 172 mile drive ahead of me tonight. Last time I made that drive I got a 92. I need get a score of 99 or 100 to maintain my spot. I guess I'll be running red lights today to avoid hard braking. Things took a left turn for the worse Its like a convergence meeting broadcast to the public.

I was 80 miles away from a 99 and I had to slow down for a yellow light without autopilot engaged and it dropped my score so much that I had to drive another 300 miles to get to a 99. I was so pissed that I decided to just fuck it and drive the 300 miles yesterday. Halfway through I had to use the brakes at a stop sign autopilot didnt see and I got flagged for harsh braking and now Im another 100 miles away from a 99. Its ridiculous and Im just really upset. I know its over something stupid, but Ive been looking forward to playing with the beta for a while knowing the state its in. Impossible, Ive been told over and over that Tesla doesnt do any QA. Just remember: if you have a car built in 2016 or most of 2017, you wont get it anyway. I had to reset and start again on Thursday. I am currently at 99. 8t is virtually impossible to get 100 in LOs Angeles. Is there a chance I get this tomorrow or do I need to drive a week? Im at 100 with 130 miles after resetting the score.

Wtb some sort of update.  They made it seem very urgent to rollback to 36.5.1 and then just revoked the 36.5.1 production build out of nowhere and haven't heard anything since. So what are people stuck on 10.3 supposed to do then? Let's get that 32.25 build 10.2 back then! i got the email at 2:55am but never got he actual update Actually they rolled back to 2021.36.5.1 which is the regular public release without FSD.  FSD version 10.2 was 2021.32.25 I can't be the only 99 that never got the email or the update right? So I rolled all the way back to non FSD beta version NHTSA They didnt issue a recall notice! Does it mean once its not beta theyll be able to test all configurations or that it will be beta forever? Isn't it their fucking hw? The update was incredibly broken for me. A 25 min drive on the highway and I received multiple FWC warnings every 5-10 seconds the entire drive. Ended up just turning it off when I parked. I never really got one until today. What is Elon thinking making all these shenanigans public? 2 week release cadence is very short for software this complex. Maybe they should switch to monthly updates. ""impossible to test all hardware configs""? LOL. Tesla has a trivial amount of hardware variants to test on. Try testing your software updates across ~60 different models, each with a few hundred possible optional configurations.  How does Tesla expect to ever get government certification for this? To do this, at very minimum every software version would need to be run trough a validation scenario for every valid hardware configuration and in every valid jurisdiction. Before it is allowed on public roads in public hands.  Tesla currently has at most a dozen hardware configs to test. They can\'t even afford a dozen in-house testers with one car each driving for a day trough a validation loop? The random FCWs caused by 10.3 dropped my overall score and Im no longer eligible for the beta.     Is anybody else in the same situation? Do you think Tesla will allow us to drop that day from the safety score or will we be forgotten whenever the next wave goes out? 10.3.1 incoming \\&gt; Standardise hardware across almost entire fleet  \\&gt; Standardise software across entire fleet  \\&gt; Blame config differences for an error created by a software component present on the entire fleet.  The first part is perfectly reasonable.    It's beta, they're doing quick iterations, there are bound to be bugs and rollbacks.  But blaming hardware configs? C'mon. Downloading beta 10.3.1 / 2021.36.5.3 now. Lets hope it does better than 10.2 or 10.3. ",171,,0

I had 10.3, then rolled back to 2021.36.5.1 and nothing yet. Had 10.2 originally with the 100s. Nothing here yet ugh Edit: **2021.36.5.3** is starting to pop up. Not on my car yet.  No new version on any tracker I know of yet, so doesnt look like it has actually started. Just checked on my 2021.36.5.2 car too.  Nice to see a quick turnaround, I hope the team gets some sleep now. Nothing yet on my MY. But yesterdays mass drop me to 98 after rollback I didn't get 10.3 but my safety score mysteriously went up while I was asleep by .3 (pushing score from 97 to 98). Anybody else experience this? Has anyone with an original AP 2.5 car gotten the beta. I'm running HW 3, mcu2 and am hearing that Tesla groups 2.5 into 2.0. which means we will not get beta Currently on 10.3 2021.36.5.2 and I didn't get anything yet Had 99 score but yesterdays multiple phantom forward collision warnings made me fall all the way to 97 Car in front was far away and not even breaking haha. Hope they discount yesterdays driving or fix the score. Wondering if they are going to address safety score. Mine was absolutely destroyed yesterday with the false forward collision. So 2021.36.5.1 was already downloaded to my car but I havent installed it yet. Will my car check for a newer update with one already downloaded and ready to install? Or do I need to install the pending update first before it will check for any newer updates?  Update: my car just notified me about 2021.36.5.3 even though I had 2021.36.5.1 already downloaded and waiting to install. Installing 2021.36.5.3 now. Part of the 100 club who has been on 10.2, got 10.3, then rolled it back, now the app says ""Software update Scheduled for Sunday 03:05pm"".  I never scheduled any update, and when I click on it to have it start now it just loops on ""Preparing to update"" for about 15-30 minutes then goes back to ""Software update"". Both my 10.3 update and Rollback update were downloaded through LTE i have 100 now, but no download. was i too late as i got 100 on saturday? nothing here yet Haven't seen it. I installed and rolled back yesterday without driving at all. SS still 100. Havent seen the update yet. Fingers crossed Wow, I\'m shocked and happy they are rolling the prior beta version out so quickly.  Really impressed.  Did anyone ""re-enroll"" in the beta program from the car app?  Or or you waiting to see if your prior enrollment was sufficient?  I don\'t want to do anything to bump my place in the line! I need the software update first. Did anyone get to 99 today and get the invite after being at 98 over the weekend? Im curious as to whether theyll start opening it up to new 99s, especially as we are hitting the rolling 30 days. On 10.3 and in my app, since yesterday when this whole thing happened, I show Software Update Scheduled For Sunday at 3pm, but it has not downloaded and Im still on 10.3.    I wonder if I have to force a download of the rollback to get the 10.3.1 update.   Anyone else in this situation? Still nothing on TeslaFi as of 7:48AM PDT. Patiently waiting  ![gif](giphy|LoCDk7fecj2dwCtSB3) Edit: Installing 2021.36.5.3 atm  Pretty sure its only being rolled out to internal testers atm. The only car Ive heard its on is a Tesla employee in NYC Can one still unenroll from the beta and re-enroll to reset safety score? Even if I drive perfect I get 96 score for trips! Like it's some kind of permanent ceiling. Has anyone who is a 99 or 100 yesterday gotten the beta yet? I qualified Friday night at like 11:30 EST. Wondering if Im going to have to wait until the next wave. Because I know people are in various situations, posting mine here in case people are similarly situated:  * 99/100 score, received FSD Beta 10.3 Sunday morning via LTE.  Never received an e-mail. * Never received an update notification for rollback to 2021.36.5.1. * Still on 2021.36.5.2 with no additional updates scheduled or pending. * My settings were remotely changed to disable FCW and AEB.  Hope that helps anyone know they are not alone if in this situation.  Thanks! Where bro? Gimme the goods Adding my info and will update this post when/if I get updated again.  * M3SR+ 2020 in the USA * 99 Score on Friday * Received 2021.36.5.2 over LTE Saturday morning including the e-mail * Experienced the bugs that many people are reporting on this forum while driving in the morning * Middle of the afternoon updated to the rollback 2021.36.5.1 * Safety score reduced to 98 because of the bugs  **Downloading 2021.36.5.3 NOW** Im at 99 score since Friday, 21 Vision Only LR Model 3. I dont know whether to be disappointed or happy that I havent gotten invited yet lol. No email or updates, still on 32.22 2021 Vision Only model Y long Range  Achieved 99 by Thursday Noon EST  Got the FSD BETA Email 2:55am EST on sunday  Never got any of the ill-fated update(s)  No 10.3.1 either  &amp;#x200B;  anyone else in a similar boat?  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: JUST GOT IT!!

Was on .2 previously and didn't rollback. Got to 99 on Friday and was pushed .2 on Sunday early morning.  Edit: Got the FSD Beta email again as well even though I received it previously Downgraded shortly after the download became available, and lost FSD (as expected). 36.5.3 downloading now (over cellular, surprisingly). Kudos to the FSD team for the quick reattack! Downloading Downloading now!   For those wondering I was rolled back yesterday, 99 score, score stayed 99 despite having some lower score drives due to FAD Just got an email from Tesla that 10.3.1 will be pushed out shortly. It was similar to the email of when I first got into the beta. Downloading 2021.36.5.3 now. Just received the email regarding 10.3.1 now, saying it will be pushed shortly to my vehicle. Downloading now! 2021.36.5.3 downloading for me. Had 99 score last Friday, was downgraded to 2021.36.5.1 with rollback but my score dropped to 97 because of phantom FCW, still part of FSD beta. Just received a notification downloading 2021.36.5.3. Currently safety score is 98. MYLR  Also received email title: Tesla | Full Self-Driving (Beta V10.3.1) Incoming!    FYI, I was an initial 100 that was downgraded to 5.1 yesterday after getting 10.3. Just got the update. Updating to 10.3.1 as we speak. 2017 Model X with MCU1 and HW2.5 upgraded to FSD and MCU2. Had 99/100 and did not roll back yesterday after getting 10.3. Im currently downloading 2021.36.5.3 currently fwiw. I also got another email that they were pushing 10.3.1 to be as well so Im guessing thats what this update is.  Stuck at 50% for the last 10 minutes though Downloading now   Edit: received email as well  Edit 2: for more info, had 10.3 yesterday morning, had one successful drive and all the bugs thereafter weve read about and downgraded to .5.1 when it was pushed out. My Model Y is downloading 36.5.3 now. Just got notification. I did not downgrade to production version even though my car downloaded it yesterday. Got initial 10.3 version yesterday morning. Glad I waited it out. Lets hope everyone who downgraded to the production version yesterday and got safely score back gets this version irregardless of score. Big thank you to the software and FSD team at Tesla for the very quick response and turnaround. 2021.36.5.3 is downloading now. I was in the original beta and downloaded 2021.36.5.1 yesterday.

Never got a chance to revert back, never drove with the broken beta, score at 100 throughout this whole fiasco. Installing 2021.36.5.3 now Downloading now. 99 score, rolled back yesterday. Looks like everyone who was originally granted FSD is getting it back! Yay!  For reference, I got beta yesterday for the first time.  99 score.  Downgraded.

Full Self-Driving is in limited early access Beta and must be used with additional caution. It may do the wrong thing at the worst time, so you must always keep your hands on the wheel and pay extra attention to the road. Do not become complacent. When Full Self-Driving Beta is enabled, your vehicle will make lane changes off highway, select forks to follow your navigation route, navigate around other vehicles and objects, and make left and right turns. Use Full Self-Driving Beta only if you will pay constant attention to the road, and be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations. Every driver is responsible for remaining alert and active when using Autopilot and must be prepared to take action at any time.         As part of receiving FSD Beta, your vehicle will collect and share VIN-associated vehicle driving data with Tesla to confirm your continued eligibility for FSD Beta feature. If you wish to be removed from the limited early access FSD Beta please email fsdbeta@tesla.com        Your vehicle is running on Tesla Vision! Note that Tesla Vision also includes some temporary limitations, as noted below:        Follow distance is limited to 2-7.    Autopilot top speed is 80 mph.    How to provide feedback:        Press the ""Video Record"" button on the top bar UI to share your feedback. When pressed, your vehicles external cameras will share a short VIN-associated Autopilot Snapshot with the Tesla engineering team to help make improvements to FSD.

This helps us investigate issues, and better understand your feedback. Downloading 10.3.1 now. What's funny is I got the message for the rollback, but didn't install it in time so I couldn't. But it looks like the car itself turned off FCW and AEB by itself, because I was 100% sure I had those on and got a bunch of FCW after the buggy 10.3 release. I was included in on the 100 safety score 10.2 rollout, but I actually just received another email saying that Im getting the 10.3.1 beta. Update complete. No new notes. AEB enabled.  FSD is working. Just got the download. On my honeymoon and can't access the car right now though to verify what has changed. I've had 10.2 for a couple of weeks, in the initial batch of the 100 safety scores that got rolled out. Got the 'upgrade' to 10.3 on Sunday, then the downgrade to 10.1 before I drove the 10.3.  Just finished getting 10.3.1 downloaded and installed. No action on my part to 're-enroll' etc. Just got 2021.36.5.3 so I guess theyre sending it out now? Any 99ers that just received their first FSD email/update? Or still waiting? Ive had 99 since Friday, no updates or emails. Hmm 10.3.1 download started over LTE. Saw that is was 50% downloaded. Then the download stopped and disappeared and Im stuck on 10.2 non-fsd  Edit: I received the download and updated a couple hours later Was pushed 5.3 about an hour ago. Downloaded and installed! Downloading and installing 10.3.1 as we write! Is 10.3.1 turning FCW and AEB back on? Have any of you who installed driven the car yet?! FYI I was in the 99 group that got enabled for beta on Sunday, got one FSD drive in before running into the No AP Available / FCW hell issue and downgraded to .1 and had no FSD, my safety score dropped to 93 after several unwarranted FCW false alarms, and I just received the new 5.3 build and I have FSD beta turned on again.  So apparently the FCW false alarms dragging down safety score do not prevent you from getting the beta build again. Installed 10.3.1 and did a quick trip down to the grocery store and back. Overall it did pretty well, there were 3 points when I hit the camera to provide feedback.   **Initial Thoughts**  * Eyes on the road is very sensitive. I got hit with autopilot not available for rest of trip half way through because i was trying to fix settings on the fly. The car was driving way too fast through the neighborhood so fix your speed offsets and everything before you start driving. * Hands on the wheel is also pretty sensitive. Keep that constant tension. I guess my hands were too loose on the wheel and it didn't feel like it was there.  **Disengagements**  * Left turn the light was yellow so the car started to go. Turned red midturn and the car stopped. On coming traffic started coming toward me so had to disengage and go around. When everyone gets a first drive in on 10.3.1, what profile mode seems to work the best for you? For me, I am finding the most aggressive mode works best on the streets around here. I noticed on my first drive, in the middle ""Average"" mode, it thinks the left lane is the ""passing"" lane, therefore keeps trying to stay in the right lane. Unfortunately, the right lane is always full of people randomly parking there. So, I\'m constantly having to disengage and get back over. The aggressive mode seems to stop that, as it is allowed to stay in the ""passing"" lane.   This is, other than the occasional phantom brake, the only real issue I\'ve had so far. There\'s a stretch of road that everyone goes a million miles an hour on , and Tesla still thinks its 25. I think we can literally boil this down to a lack of a speed limit sign, but its a first world problem that I\'m having to always hit the gas pedal around there to keep up with traffic. Ive had a 99 Score since Thursday and no update or email. Ive even driven over a 100 miles so far with a 99 score. Is there something Im missing? Didn't catch the rollback in time, but received the alert to update to 2021.36.5.3 in my Raven X this morning.  Took it for a drive and was pretty messed up.  The visualization was blinking on and off, and I had an error to set a service appointment for a software update, which I thought was weird.  I couldn't engage autopilot.  The error to contact service went away after a soft reboot.  Going to let it sit for an hour and look again shortly. I just installed 36.5.3 from 36.5.2 and everything is super buggy. Car says to schedule a service appointment for a software update. FSD, AP, and even auto-windshield wipers don't work. The visualization on car keeps flashing... Everything was working fine with 36.5.2, wth? Just took it for a spin. Mostly a good experience. It really struggles with roads covered in leaves and debris.  It's been very stormy here so the roads are a mess but it mostly did well for a 10 mi round trip. Basic question for those in the know. I didnt want to make a new thread to ask but Im new to the FSD beta and was wondering I know NoA is still a different stack than city streets and I know theyre shooting for a unified software stack by v11. My question is in regards to summon and FSD. Is summon/smart summon still the same if youre in the beta or have there been improvements? Is it in on the same stack as city streets or is there literally no difference with smart summon with/without FSD beta? Thanks. I got in and got the FSD beta. Tried to use FSD for a quick Starbucks run. Had 3 major disengagements in less than a mile. Would not recommend. This has a loooong way to go. first time getting the beta as i had a score of 99. so far so good as i remind myself its still only a beta. i was wondering though, my FSD visualization does not expand as ive seen on other drivers YT vids. anybody having this issue? 2021 Model Y LR here. I have had a safety score of 99 since last Tuesday but still havent received an email or an update on general. Anyone else? After 2 fake FCW and many miles later. I just leveled up from 98 to 99 on safety score. Will I get into the beta this round or so I need to wait until the next update and when the 98s get in ? Drove home from work and around town for a bit on 10.3.1. No FCW or AEB. Mine is set to Medium and on. Sentry is on. Everything appears to working as it should.  Tried driving it on Assertive profile. It's pretty aggressive accelerating and braking. I guess it's good for those who drives in a hurry. Argh. Still waiting for The Button to show up...

Looking at the ""FUN"" people have at electrify America stations that looked rather painless. No squinting at a touch screen AND then digging in an app. I guess this is good overall, but isn't Tesla giving away a key market advantage in this way? and aren't superchargers already overcrowded in some areas? Trying to find the correct App. I downloaded the only Tesla branded app from the ios store and it just wants to sell me shirts and cables. Hyundai guy here wanting to suck some of that sweet sweet Tesla juice. Man these titles are all so misleading.   Its a test pilot of 10 supercharger stations and only in the Netherlands.  The title would have you assume all superchargers globally. Thank you for doing and showing this. Super interesting. For a while I thought, wow that's a nice Taycon you have there. Will get a kick out of some other EV owners who talk shit about Tesla plugged into the super chargers haha 4 Euro for 7KW? Wow thats expensive. I  am curious if 63kW was the max the car could take or it was throttled based on SOC.  Thanks for posting OP! Buying a connector isn't a big deal. I don't think that will limit adoption. All these Tesla elitists butthurt they may have to share their privileges with the filthy commoners.  No, this is a necessary step. Imagine having gas stations that only service one brand of cars. If we want this to be the future, we have to integrate. Wait. Its pronounced porshy? I thought it was porsha. So many photos we've seen are people blocking two spots to charge... this could be a problem... Already have to wait to find a charger. Now it gets worse. Seems like the membership pays for itself in one charge",398,"Ionity, fastnet have to drop their prices. Good for consumers. Even Tesla drivers as we still have routes where we would like to have more stations along. Also worried as tesla owner. The network is definitely and buy reason. Basically it ruled any other car . As shareholder Look forward to exponential growth of charging stations. This is in Europe where all chargers and cars regardless of brand are CCS2?  I wonder if Tesla will bite the bullet and transition to CCS1 in NA. They will have to in the end. Adapters are bullshit.   Tesla Taiwan recently switched over to CCS2. Tesla says theyll support the Tesla connector until 2025 and beyond (V2 Superchargers with dual connectors, and V3 being split 1:3 so far), but the writings on the wall for cars sold before Q3 this year with the old Tesla connector. The situation is made worse by the fact that the main standard is CCS1, incompatible with CCS2 that Tesla adopted (or was forced to adopt in Taiwan, as rumors go). According to the Tesla employees..we have to first connect the charger. Uhhhh yea I believe thats how charging works. Longer wait time, no more peace in mind Why this guy sounds like crying? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|laughing) I wonder what happens when superchargers are packed during holidays? They will be even more backed up.... What BS. Tesla literally giving away it's actual biggest advantage. It's never been the cars, it's always been the charging network.   What's stopping prospective buyers now saying 'ahh fuck it, I'll just buy the better car like a Taycan or E tron GT now that their biggest disadvantage is now it's strength'   What a stupid decision.",38

This is another of those science stories that is genuinely interesting but the media blows it out of proportion with sensationalist headlines like: ""NASA to save all life on Earth by diverting asteroid!"" or ""Bruce Willis style mission to redirect asteroid!""  That\'s no what they\'re doing. The asteroid they\'re going to redirect is only a baby, 160 meters wide. It\'s not on a collision course with anything and they\'re aiming to change it\'s speed by 0.4mm/s.  It\'s still really cool and very important research. But the outcome will be data on a graph gathered over several weeks/months of radar imaging tests, the outcome won\'t be a nuclear explosion with Steve Buscemi wooping like a cowboy. What do they actually want to find out with this mission? Seems like the effect an impact has on a trajectory can easily be calculated. This is a much bigger deal than people realize.  Pretty sure this is SpaceX's first interplanetary mission.   I'm excluding the fh test launch cause that didn't have a real destination in mind.  This is the most distant target for SpaceX so far.

Do you support this?",122.0,185.0,"Nope. I honestly dont understand the question No. To do what with the gains? Pay taxes on half (as if the government spends its money better than you), then give away the rest?  Haters will say you're still just paying less than 6% of your wealth, and giving away that much money wisely is a huge distraction. The only way this makes sense is if it shames or inspires many billionaires who aren't contributing positively to do the same. Good luck with that.  But you could work on a great pedal-assisted autonomous electric bike that the median household in India (135000 rupees per capita * 4.4 people per household * 20% = $1600) could afford. If he sells his stock and pays 53% tax on it and had billions in the bank then people will say he needs to pay a wealth tax.  This isn't about what's fair.  It's that people who don't like Musk and his lack of political conformity want him to be knocked down a peg via the government stealing his money. Would the money paid in taxes to the government be spent in an efficient manner? I have little faith it would.  To be clear, I realize thats true regardless if Elon sells any stock. Its the one company having some of the largest impact in the world and now itll be a rounding error in the tax budget. Please dont sell to pay taxes. Governments just give them to other corporations. Please use your wealth to actually help the people somehow. Food for those in the world starving. Clean water to those in need. You have great power and respect. People will do the footwork for great things that your wealth can provide. Micro loans to other small business too. Also please can we get the cyber truck in Canada soon! (sorry, had to throw one in for me) Hell no, dont let them take your hard earned money, you do more for the world with one company than we could achieve with 100% of your wealth wtf Elon, do you really want to let twitter make your decisions for you? I hope he has a good plan with it. He isn't going to ever stop the socialists from trying to take his money and use it to pay themselves admin fees as they dribble crumbs into us poor peoples mouths while they tell us how bad we are at life and crippling our ability to help ourselves out. If he goes through and liquidated 10% of his holdings. That equates to 3% of the company which would put that at ~$30B right now. Obviously he wont be able to sell them all without the price tanking drastically, so lets assume he only gets $10B. Pays $5.3B to government in taxes, keeps $4.7B.  Would this be the greatest amount of liquid USD ever held by an individual? Has to be close Id imagine Elon is incredibly gifted.  He should be making his own decision with counsel from his advisors. This will just empower the ridiculous mob of people calling for this BS.  Why, Elon? Why? Why pay the government, when you can actually help with world starvation and have it as a tax write off Wouldnt that cause a price crash and perfect opportunity to buy in? Musk coming in with another 4d chess move here. He wants to sell some tesla to fund the Mars mission anyway but doing so would crash the stock/ worry everyone. This way he gets to cash out some just after a nice run up to a pretty high valuation and satisfy the mob on taxes, starting his transition to full time on spacex. He knows exactly what he is doing.. turning a problem into an opportunity. The dude is trying to help the planet. He should be exempt from tax. No! I cannot for a whole lot of reasons that should be obvious to the informed....... Is this a way for him to sell without crashing the stock? he lives in Austin, Texas and there is no personal income tax in Texas, correct ?  so it doesnt make any difference - the  oligarchs can play the tax laws anyway ...  Tesla cofounder and CEO Elon Musk revealed in early June that he now only owns one house (in the Bay Area)and that his primary residence is a tiny box house that he says he rents from his rocket company, SpaceX.  The house, which is around 400 square feet, is located in **Boca Chica, Texas,** What good will it do when they cant manage the money they already get .we need to turn our attention to our governments and politicians and what theyre doing with the money .   we need to STOP them from insider trading to thats criminal shit .  Just my opinion what do I know Wouldn't that hurt you more than him lol No way! No  He would do 10-100x more with that $$ for the US and humanity than any government program. Just look at the results of his companies and the number of high paying jobs they create.   I he sad truth is that Itll pump ~$10B into the government coffers which will just get wasted on bureaucracy instead of actually helping people.   I lament him relenting to the mob that just want to eat the rich instead of focusing on the real problem of wildly out of control government spending that produces little to no results.",270,"Genius move, sell you shares at an all time high. No! Dont cave to the hate mongers. I feel sick to my stomach. When fucking Exxon and big oil CEOs made billions they paid jack shit in taxes. Yet not one person blinked or said anything about their wealth accumulation. Rex Tillerson even served as the secretary of state. Almost all of the jackasses complaining want to eat someone elses lunch rather than working for their own. Great time to be alive. Youre all sycophantic cucks.    Stop being capitalist shills. No..  screw the Democrat Party and their thieving money hungry hacks!  It's your money! If he sells and govt gets the 53% liquidated cash, it will help the govt to reverse the inflation(a little) caused by excessive printing.

Have we ever seen anything like this from any of the world's richest people ... a public poll on what they should do with their money? He should sell it. Rattle the system. Pay some taxes. Lead by example. While he may be able to do more public good with his money, most billionaires won't/don't. He should do what he wants to. He'll need to sell anyway. Even if he sells, the complainers will still complain. Can someone tell me what the numbers are at right now? No Twitter for me Can this get him in trouble with the SEC again? I hope he watches Daughters of destiny  on Netflix. So I have 3 peas that I bought for a penny apiece.  Suddenly peas become enormously valuable, and they become worth $10 each, and I have to pay $2.97 this year in taxes on my peas, at 10% tax.  My limited income does not allow me the extra money, so I sell one of my peas to pay the taxes.  Will I also have to pay taxes on the $7.03 I now have in capital gains?  Following year, peas become worth $100 each, I was forced to sell one the year previous and have now theoretically lost the opportunity to make $99.97 on my lost pea.  But still,  I have to sell my remaining 2 peas to pay the new taxes.  Now I have no peas.  Clearly, I have little understanding of markets; but this seems to me a bit unfair.  Would it be better to tax corporations a certain percent on net profits before capital purchases?  Treating corporations like individual entities has led to a lot of tax evasion, but that horse has left the barn. Corporate reform, stopping the offshore shelters, things like that will help a lot more over time than Elon Musks 1-time shedding of stock. Taxes are made to short us. And don't let us realize our dreams If he thinks the government is doing such a good job that they deserve a tip then its his choice. Do what's best for you and your family. Gov can just borrow to oblivion. Practicing for Mars governance If this is an attempt to gain sympathy for the wealthiest person in the world, it won't work. Actually it is going to have the opposite effect. I pay more in taxes than elon. I wait tables Elon - sells $20B in stock.  Elon - immediately shorts Tesla.  Stock price goes down.

I dont understand, isnt he gonna pay more if people just wait ? Dont his option ends in february or something like that ? He just try to please people that cant be please IMO I mean, Tesla stock is all times high, if he sells and pay the taxes, then waits for it to get to 900 to buy agin, he is actually making money out of it. Not that I support the people making a problem out of this, but Elon can actually trick those people into thinking that he did what they wanted and improve his popularity Can someone please explain why it's just Musk and Tesla stock that is mentioned here?  What about Bill Gates/Microsoft, Jeff Bezos/Amazon, The Walton Family/Wal-Mart, Zuckerberg/Facebook (actually on MZ and Facebook, what exactly has this fuckwit and piece of shit company contributed to humanity?) etc, etc If you want to start improving America, taxing the rich and giving a two party government more money to spend is not it. A multi political party system of government, minimum wage and free healthcare like most modern democracies around the world would be a good start....... this man is a living legend This is a fucking ridiculous post. Pls delete. Hes got options expiring at the end of the year. Plus, hes got it, why not pay some taxes. And no one in the US, calls the US, the USA. Stop already. What a stupid thing to do. The government just pilfers those taxes anyway. 90% is wasted and pilfered in the hands of government. The money will do more for humanity in the hands of musk than in the hands of the taxspending degenerates. \u200d people have over reacted to claims that he\'s the richest man etc. None of it is actual money. There\'s no income. The ""wrath"" these websites report is his stock market assets.   His stock value assets isn\'t income, especially when he isn\'t selling/sold them.   He *could* take a loan against the value of the stock as collateral, but the loan money isn\'t taxable income.   Before you know it, this will become a rule...... And effect many households across America. Every average American that has taken a loan at some point, could be liable to pay tax on the income that wasn\'t actually income. Do not cave to the greedy hate mongers. he has to sell regardless What? Why is voting yes such a bad thing? Seriously?  It is the biggest ball move ever.  1. He has so much paper money he is trying to convert to real money and just pay the tax.  (est. 4.6B)  He doesn't care. 2. He get all the credit. 3. Everyone would look at all the other people in similar situations (Bezos, Buffet ...) to step up and do the same. 4. Imagine if that much stock was cashed out ... it would start the next recession let's all vote yes so we can fix life for the people who're tortured by wealth horders like him This sub is just rediculous. Its proof that being partially informed and confident is by far the most dangerous position What if he just took a commensurate salary and paid some tax on his W2 like the rest of us? I honestly dont think this is the reason hes doing it. I think he just wants to sell, he just doesnt want to cause a panic. When an owner or coo sells off large chunks people may think something is wrong and panic sell.. explained to me by another Reddit user way smarter than me. He/she also explained it way better  Calm down guys, he has some [expiring stock options worth 20B+ he has to sell anyways]( He's just taking advantage of that to get some political leverage. ITT a lot of people think Elon paying Capital Gains Tax when he sells stock / income tax when his options mature somehow excuses his avoidance of other taxes by borrowing against his stock and relying on his estate being able to sell stock to cover the debt at 0CGT.   Elon has $112 billion worth of shares tied up as collateral for loans like this, but somehow he paid _some_ of his taxes so it's ok that he avoids others. He should give the money to team seas. Yeah, let's not tax every billionaire because I like this one... There was a study on this recently that showed that people opposed taxes on all the wealthy because they sympathieze with one or a few of them. See the plan, Tesla stock goes down, he will pay the taxes on his capital gains and buy the dip and own more Tesla.   And if it backfires, more publicity anyway. He's a fucking genius. Do you guys think hes really gonna sell? I'm new to investing in general, I have some stocks in Tesla... should I sell immediately now (obv not rn, but queued for Monday)? Will I lose a ton of $ as soon as Monday rolls around?",266,"There is an article floating around that explains that Elon is essentially forced to sell stock to fund exercising the options package that he received. Its either sell Tesla stock or take out a multi-billion dollar loan. Not stonks I dn. He didn't abide by the results of the Tesla accepting doge pole. Guess we find out Monday. Be a crazy Tesla dip if he does it. So this is a great way to allow him to invest in other companies like SpaceX, The Boring Company, or that brain one The american government (I american) is extremely dysfunctional. They spend borrowed money like a drunken saylor.  This was not what the founding fathers wanted and warned us to stay far away from.  I feel elon is 100% sincere, he wants to better life, and he has in so many ways already.  The government needs to back off so he can move foward with his plans! Its not like anyone in the government or private sector has any better ideas. What no,  have him pay his taxes. He's not god [Here is the link if you want to vote:]( Poll is currently 55 - 45 for.. That aint gone happen bruh , hes selling Vote yes for a just market Finally, a great post. They bother him always but never mention Buffet, Gates or Zuckerberg He is just trolling, I dont think he will sell. And I am 100% sure he is not gonna listen to the results of this silly poll. But the stock is likely to go down on Monday because of his tweet whether he sells or not. I am not sure who is supposed to benefit from all of this. Vote YES! A million votes His stock options r expiring and I believe he is having no choice but to sell,, its what I saw in a interview with him it he is forced to pay a live 50% tax on the stock he sells Symbolism is powerful &gt;Imagine thinking you'll be rich hanging onto the tweets of the elite...  r/dogecoin didn't even want your BS.   I like Elon but why shouldn't he pay more with a clause to prove a point? No! Wheres the link to vote plz It's down to 53% and 47% so far. Get out there and vote people. Possible scenario.   Elon, of all people knows the stock is way over-valued. So he takes a little profit and pays a little tax. Net worth is the same as if the stock tanks by 10%. Plus he gets to play the hero.  I'm not saying this to be mean. I'm a big fan. I say no its not his fault its the governments miss management of money and  over spending . Definitely need a phone booth in my office on tax payer expense I voted no - the left will vote yes overwhelmingly so. The opinion of the left has nothing to do with objective numbers, and everything to do with jealousy, envy, issues with other ppl doing well, only being as well off as they want you to be, it never ends. Communist type of thinking shrouded internally in the minds of liberals. I voted yes, fuck billionaires I voted no.  Elon Musk will allocate the money much better than the government.   Heck, the government spent trillions of dollars bombing little Arabs for decades (the innocent collateral damage is appalling). And the soy-boys in the USA have the nerve to shame at Musk to give his fair show of money to the government like they will even use $1 of that to help people!?",13

If the gains are unrealised, then you don't have the money in the first place. Don't cater to those people, they will hate you whatever you do. Its in the ballpark range to raise enough money to exercise and pay the taxes on his CEO options package. Come on guys vote NO. There are more YESes. People getting heated over his decision to tweet this: why? This is hilarious!   Voting yes.   I love the chaotic energy.   For those who are sad about stock dipping just buy the dip. I don't have Twitter. What's the poll currently at? (Y/N ratio) This is pointless. It does not matter at all what Elon Musk does in this situation, it matters what the US government does to change the tax law. I don't blame the rich for using every tax loophole available to them, I blame the US government for leaving those loopholes open. Don't CEOs typically have set rules on when they can execute options? Our execs had that to help with insider trading laws. Elon is 4D, if Twitter poll is yes.  Expect another tweet before market opens.   Maybe buyer is lined up. There is no timeline in his tweet. So he might sell only in 2050. I voted yes so he could take that money (minus taxes) and just dump it into spaceX.  I expect we are approaching a local maximum for the stock price.  I accept your downvotes graciously. Oh fuck here we go. Looks like his plan is to buy 400,000 bitcoin This vote seems more important than any shareholders proxy vote Ive ever made My entire money is in VTI but I am wanting to put about 5-10% in TSLA. Should I vote yes or no, I'm not a stocks guy.. Taxing unrealized gains is crazy. To be fair, it would have to work both ways - if a stock price sinks that you can recover some of those taxes paid in the previous year as a tax refund.  But even that is crazy.  Just imagine someone having put maybe a few K into crypto and it 100xes on the cutoff date for the unrealized tax, so you would owe a few  average yearly salaries in taxes and then boom - the price drops down to what it was before (or less) - so now you're stuck with a tax bill with no way to pay for it. When you actually have a realized gain, you can actually put money on the side to pay the taxes, but with an unrealized gain, you can't do that. Me when Elon votes to crash his stock: Haha^yes If he gives it to team seas then yes. Holy cow. RIP to Tesla Call holders. I find this hilarious.   Its nuts to me to read the comment count in these threads on r/teslamotors and r/teslainvestorsclub and see *below 500 comments*     Post to Twitter to get the word out there, collect the thoughts of a billion people overnight via the comments, best comments on Twitter get quoted and posted on reddit (probably this very sub lol)   Read through the comments on reddit, boom, you've just filtered the collective thoughts of the world, in less than 48 hours, with 5 minutes writing and 20 minutes reading, for free.

How is this much volume typically handled? As usual, Ill do nothing and get richer on TSLA. Lets vote no and see if hes for real What decision would benefit a stockholder? What I'm concerned about is simply tweeting this may amount to stock market manipulation, which could expose him to all kinds of liability. Hes going to put it all in crypto Silverman predicts the effect on shareholders will be minimum, partly because the sales wont be a surprise.  Musk will likely continue to be vocal about what hes doing  exercising the options because theyre close to expiration, selling stock because of the enormous tax bill and because of the liquidity of Tesla shares, he said. I hope Musk realizes how important the wording of his question is for such an internet poll. Most don't see much more than Elon asking 'do you support this' which will favor 'Yes'.  If he had carefully explained both options and call it option X and option Y afterwards the results may be different. Plot twist: Most of the country can't agree on how tax dollars should be spent anyway. If he tanks the price, I'm buying.  Next year is going to be insane for TSLA. Impossible. I was told by countless Reddit users that stocks arent real money and you cant ever cash them out because they are worthless so they shouldnt be taxable or count as income. Why let Twitter degenerates decide that? So if he sells 10% of its stock, what is he going to do with that 10%, keep it? Because then that's just cash in the bank for him The solution isnt taxation on unrealized gains - implementation would create massive market and economic inefficiency. Ideology around economic equality doesnt change that fact.  The fix is removing the cost basis step-up. It doesnt make sense that if someone dies with unrealized gains, those gains are never taxed. No I don't support this. (1)I think this is an effort for these large investment firms to try slowly take over tesla cause when elon sells who really buys? (2) if the issue were about world hunger, homelessness, mental illness, or even stopping human trafficking, i dont believe for 1 minute there is a government entity that would do a good job at distributing the equity to the right places or people in need.  If Elon wanted to distribute to the masses on his own without government involvement I would agree with that. (3) Elon could effectively put the proceeds back into the hands of the masses by just driving up cryptocurrencies, this too would do more good for more people that what any government could do. (4) which is my favorite approach, tell them to go f themselves that you aren't selling and they have enough funds already that the government entities need to just do a better job at spending it in the right places.

Can he donate shares?  Donate 10x 1% shares to 10 major international charities. Let them make decision as to whether they hold or sell.  Let them borrow against the assets if they want.  By major international charity I mean a diverse group of charities that are well vetted, well respected, non-wasteful, not political, not controversial, etc.  [Edit: Thanks for the downvotes, care to explain why?] Question will be: what's he going to do with the money (after taxes)? There's currently not much that would be worth it to do with that much cash. No bad idea for him to give up that much ownership!  I do not have TSLA stick but if I was a shareholder would be out there voting against this as it will have negative Impact on the company Taxation is theft. always with the twitter bs And just like that, Musk makes the case for taxing folks like him. Basically he is saying that tax obligations are optional for people in his situation.   He says he doesn't take salary or bonuses, but fails to mention the low interest, stock-backed loans he gets to pay for his lifestyle.   We need a special carve out for people like him, but we'll have his stans defending him despite the fact that he has greatly benefitted from our system without paying his fair share to maintain it. He will still only pay 20% tax which is less than everyone on this subreddit. The law has to change. Capital Gains tax need to be increased.  Remember that the wealthiest 10% own  89% of all stocks. Im not talking about yall. Can someone create a bot and vote NO?   Votes should only be for shareholders, not everyone. Someone take away his phone. Jesus Christ. Nope.  They want to tax it all. Id feel better if he gave 0.1% to me.  Anything other than that its just another billionaire trying to take advantage of the little guys. No. Never. By taking valuable shares away from people that created the value, you are taking capital away from what are proven to be the most effective capital allocators. The you are transferring it to the people with the worst proven track record of capital allocation. Everyone is missing the con here. Hes claiming he wants to sell this to pay taxes. In the meantime he can diversify $20 billion while the stock is at an all time crazy high, without making his fans think hes trying to cash out at the top. Hes realized the 23.5% tax rate looks better than the downside risk on his not diverse portfolio. Billionaires dont need all you poor people defending their every move. Its really pathetic. Do your due diligence, press No Musk, I don't give a shit if you wish to hoard more and more till your heart's content. He's such a dramaqueen sometimes. Just fucking do what you want ...why make it into a reality show? If Musk was to sell 10% of his stock portfolio we're talking billions of dollars here. Can we list all the ways he could spend billions that would have a more tangible, direct impact on people than just giving it to the government? Shit, even with all the bureaucracies of many large charity organizations it would still probably benefit poor people more than paying it in taxes to the Feds.   And yes, I understand that selling stocks is a taxable event, so don't point that out. I'm saying if he wasn't taxed for that but still sold it with the intent to do good for the world there's way better ways to give out billions than hand it over to Uncle Sam. Nothing Musk is saying here is wrong, he\'s just not telling the whole story. He will indeed pay income tax when realising stock options, but one of the major problems with the US tax system is that once he\'s got them Musk can make money that is functional income - as in money that lands in his bank account for him to spend - without ever having to sell those shares and suffer capital gains tax OR class it as interest or dividends or a salary and pay income tax. Here\'s how it works: On November 1st 2016, Tesla was worth $27.5b at $37.88 a share. Musk owns roughly 25% of Tesla, which makes the value of his stake $9.47 billion. Let\'s say he wants $100million per year in spending money; banks will issue loans to a value of about 67% the collateral value, so he puts up about $1.5bil in shares as collateral on a $1bil loan (15.8% of his stake). Now interest rates for this kind of thing are dirt, dirt cheap; single figures cheap. Let\'s top that out and call it 9% interest, over a 5 year term. That\'s $90m * 5 = $450mil in interest, which he pays off with the loan money, leaving $110 million per year of doing billionaire-stuff money for him to blow, tax free, on whatever the hell he wants. 5 years later, it\'s November 1st 2021. Tesla is now worth $1.1trillion. That 25% stake Musk owns is worth $275billion. His loan is due, so what does he do? He could sell a preposterously small percentage of his stake, pay the taxes, and then pay off the loan. But he doesn\'t do that, instead he goes to bank B and takes out another loan. This time he wants more doing-billionaire-stuff money, and he has to pay off his original $1billion loan. He takes out a loan for $4billion dollars, which requires nearly $6billion in collateral; this time that\'s just over 2% of his stake instead of nearly 16%. He will need to pay $1.8 billion in interest on top of his original $1 billion loan, so that leaves $4b - $2.8b = $1.2 billion of doing-billionaire-stuff money; $240 million a year. At the ridiculously low income tax rates we have today, Musk in the above scenario should have paid over $200million in income taxes during that first 5 year period, instead he can pay absolutely nothing. Not a single cent. All the while living the kind of lifestyle only a $110 million annual expenditure can buy you, and start the next 5 year period on twice that money having risked a fifth of what he originally did. This is why the ""But It\'s Not Actual Money In His Account"" defense is so ridiculous; billionaires use their capital to access colossal amounts of cash without having to sell their stakes; as long as their stocks appreciate at a rate more than twice that of the stupid low interest on their loans, they\'re laughing all the way to their bank. The end game of all of this of course is that you die, and your heirs inherit both your assets and your liabilities. But here\'s the goofy thing; when they sell your stock, your heirs pay capital gains tax on the increase in value from the point they inherited them, not from whenever you originally got them. So if you die at the end of that second 5 year period with an outstanding $4 billion loan, your heirs simply sell $4 billion of inherited stock for $0 tax and pay off your debt - then go take out their own loan. Obviously I\'m making these numbers up. For example, my 9% interest rate figure is total bogus, in fact this kind of thing costs them around 0.85%. Similarly the paltry $6bil of collateral I\'m using an example above is far wide of the mark; the actual value of Musk\'s shares tied up as loan collateral is $112 billion (92million shares at todays price of $1223). I\'ll let you do the math on that.  Comment credit: tree_bom He's a tax dodger, plain and simple.",50

Anyone know of any other photos of the underside of this rocket? That's around 5.4 Gigagrams! Gg! If only i would know how much a pound is. I wonder if the center cluster will have that ""nub"" that the Merlin engines have to prevent them from colliding with each other? 5,443 metric tons of thrust at liftoff. So based on this and using thrust to weight ratio we can set some parameters for the all up weight of the total superheavy / starship stack.  If I recall a T/W ratio of 1.5 at liftoff had been mentioned in the past. This would put the stack weight at a touch over 3,600 tonnes  The Saturn 5 which took off slowwww had a T/W ratio of about 1.2 which for the Starship stack gives an all up weight of roughly 4,500 tonnes.  Measure the acceleration of the first launch and assuming the thrust is nominal you can easily get the stack weight. Ladies and gentlemen I present to you the most powerful rocket... In the world. Just twelve ? Does anyone know if raptors will have same heat protection for the upper stage? I know the belly  entry will protect them, but after doing the belly flop maneuver and igniting they might also be a bit exposed.  Seems not to be part of the plans yet.

This might piss off a lot of pro-globalists/internationalists and a is a huge paradigm shift from what we have been told about a future Manned Mars Mission for decades  * no one asked Elon how he planned to terraform/para terraform Mars   * he was not sure how colonize Mars, my guess is he is still forming a basic plan, as the main focus is first building the infrastructure to actually get us there, aka put the Horse Before the Cart. Anything mentioned about E2E?  That's what I'm looking forward to...

That was a big surprise to me; I think of it as a pretty significant probability of ""closing of the window"" Begins at [6:49:13]( I put that video playing while at work this morning, I never got as far as Elon talking so just listened to a load of people talking about funding for over an hour..   I've come home from work, queued up the video again and........ they've made it private.  FML. According to this site, one would need a square of 150 miles on a side, equal to 22,500 square miles, or 13,750,000 acres to house the 7.85 Billion solar panels and x batteries needed to supply the whole US with Electrical power, based on our usage of 3.8 TKWh in 2020:  #:~:text=About%207.86%20billion%20solar%20panels,4000%20billion%20kWh%20of%20electricity.  I would be very interested to see how Elon gets his 100km square to do the job. They just made the video private. I'm glad that Elon addressed the problem of cryogenic propellant storage in Mars missions. He said that superinsulated cryogenic tanks would be used and would probably be spherical tanks located in the payload bay. These tanks would be zero boiloff tanks (ZBOTs) with internal passive reliquifiers for the methalox needed for the landing burn.  He also addressed one questioner's concern about forward contamination (Earth-to-Luna, Earth-to-Mars) by saying that Mars is a big place and human presence would be concentrated at bases that are microscopic in area compared to the entire surface of Mars.   The heat shield tiles and the leeward side stainless steel will experience high temperatures during the Mars EDL. That environment will probably do a good job of destroying any biological material on the Ship's hull.   And contamination from the interior of Ship will be contained inside by a combination airlock and associated decontamination chamber built into the payload bay. And any Mars contamination will be prevented from entering the interior of Ship.   The skirt part of the hull containing the engines probably will be sterilized during the trans mars injection (TMI) burn and during the landing burn. The three Rvac nozzles will be white hot (2400F (1316C)) for up to 5 minutes during each burn. The thermal radiation from the nozzles will heat the interior of the skirt to sterilization temperatures in excess of 1000F (538C).

I love it I love it. I don't think we'll ever achieve FTL, though, or that FTL is achievable in any way. No matter how you look at it, it would destroy our entire understanding of physics.   I think the issue of interstellar travel will most likely not be solved by a company like SpaceX, but rather by a company like Neuralink. As in, travelling far within the confines of the speed of light is impossible for us because we die. The only way we'll be able to withstand interstellar travel is if we can download our brains into a computer or artificial body, and preserve our own consciousness forever. !remindme 359 years !RemindMe 42069 years Starhopper II Current laws of physics and relativity are not finished but accelerating mass faster than light isn't easy if not impossible.  The stern particle accelerator gets a high percentage of the speed of light but the calculations appear to be correct ( mass can't travel at the speed of light)  But intangled particles have a connection between each other that we can't explain.  This could even develop into teleportation. Our PC's need unforseen power to make this a reality. Is teleportation FTL? It is instant.   The smart people of the world haven't ruled out the possibility of a warp drive... Compressing the very fabric of space time Infront of your ship and expanding spacetime behind your ship and theoretically you could travel large distances at arbitrary speeds.   I think interstellar travel will be done but the first ships will be slow generational ships. The closest solar system that may be of interest is about 4 lightyears away.  The tricky parts of getting their are building a self-sufficient generational space ship that  can fully support life and a power source. Need big power. Nuclear fusion might be enough. Even if it was just a giant fusion torch on one end and the point end on the other and it took 400 years to get from Earth to Alpha Centauri, at sunlight speeds, it would *still* be called Starhopper.  If we did figure out FTL, then it would be a Lightship :P I like the way you think !remindme 90000 years !remindme 10000 years &gt;If SpaceX ever builds an FTL ship, in any century, it WILL be called Starhopper  Maybe they can continue the Culture theme and call their FTL ship *Just Read The Instructions*. By special relativity, if you can achieve FTL travel then you can travel back in time.  So if SpaceX builds an FTL ship in any century, they can have an FTL ship in every century. Hi u/rartrarr  Don't be too downhearted at people's response, for some conventional attitudes are like comfort blankets. Yes physics says it's impossible to move faster than light because it requires infinite energy - but that's in our physical universe. We believe our universe came from somewhere else before the big bang and postulate there are other parallel worlds and higher dimensions. These use expanded physical laws so no reason why they might not be used for FTL assuming you can access them. And to address your question, humans love to give grand titles to projects - good example NASA has to use acronyms because their project names are so long. Something as momentous as FTL will probably receive a monstrous acronym - like HYPERION or STARLANCE etc. But if you can make a suitable acronym from Starhopper, why not. Im no theoretical physicist, and I hope none will find this thread. Else they will despair. You're maybe early, but not wrong. No because of relativity  the close you get to the speed of light the more the mass increases. Sorry you cannot beat physics! And if you bring up Einstein Rosenberg bridges you do not practically know what is actually physically involved ! There is no such thing as FTL. Best rip that bandaid off now.   No. There is no ""well thats what we think NOW but in the future..."". No I don\'t ""lack inaginination"".   We actually already know enough now to rule it out entirely. FTL violately causality itself and if you study these things deep enough you eventually learn that causality is the deepest ""mover of laws"".   There is no FTL or else literally everything falls apart.   Every rigorous attempt at it requires ""negative energy"" or ""negative mass"". Which is a fancy way of saying the math doesn\'t work. And no it is not the same as ""anti matter"". Its entirely different. Anti matter isn\'t ""negative"" in that sense.    Believe me, I\'ve heard whatever objection you\'re going to raise and I assure it doesn\'t work or you are wrong.   No FTL ever, in any way. Accept it. Rip that band aid off. It isn\'t that we haven\'t discovered the way yet, its that what we already know blatantly tells us it can\'t happen. Causality is the final mover of physics and FTL breaks causality. I could write a book to elaborate but you\'ll have to accept that.     However. Its still possible to go interstellar with O\'Neil cylinder generation ships. With efficient fusion we could do 33% the speed of light and it would only take a century or two to reach say, Tau Ceti or Epsilon Eridani. And models say even at this fraction of light speed the entire galaxy could be colonized in 1 or 10 million years. (The models say 1, I say 10 to be conservative, but either is NOTHING on geologic timescales). And life on these ships would be a paradise, not a burden. It would be a better life than most have now, even if you were in the middle generation and never say Earth nor the destination. Comfortable but with plenty of work to do. See now this maybe be big thinking, but its entirely allowed by physics, unlike FTL, which isn\'t.    Give up on FTL, but that doesn\'t mean giving up on interstellar colonization. !remindme 16000 years  Bonus points to anyone who understands what universe I postulate we live in based on my guessed date. We're not getting FTL ships. MuskDrive !remindme 50 years Call it Time Bandit. Fair enough ! - but the FTL part is very unlikely. And its probably not happening this century.  SpaceX could build an interstellar probe sometime in the future, but still this century, but that would not be FTL.  And hardly worthwhile, because too slow.  Short of that, there are some useful distance missions, that while long distance, still fall far short of interstellar.  For example, the Solar Scope Mission, the Oort Cloud Mission, the Planet-9 Mission.    (have to find it first ! - Maybe the James Webb can help there ? Does it really even exist ?)  Before then there are plenty of shorter - long distance missions to the outer planets and their moons.  Endless fun !  FTL if it ever happens will be breakthrough physics and closely linked to Power physics  Its very likely that such things would require the manipulation of very high amounts of energy.  Interstellar missions would be possible at sub-light speeds, but obviously rather limited and even then not for some considerable time.  But for right now, there are more than enough challenges in the inner Solar System:  Earth Orbit, The Moon, Mars, even Ceres and the Asteroid Belt.  We will likely be busy for hundreds of years, thousands even. Still waiting on the first Enterprise to actually fly in space... We are yeast in a wine bottle.  If we are lucky we will migrate some portion of ourselves to another bottle but we arent going to hop to another winery.  Not in this century any way, and this bottle will be wine long before then.

Like, you want me to convert CO2 to fuel as well? I'll get right to work on my rocket fuel tree I guess. Like literally the opposite of what blue origin are in the news for. Bit obvious timing really, wonder if the marketing team saw Blythe headlines about their flight yesterday and asked Elon to make a thing to fix what Bezoss lot just did. There are far better ways, such as out of the stack of a cement plant. Far higher CO2 concentration. Still need fantastic amounts of energy, but lower concentration costs. Yall have great self esteem i wish I was so confident I'm curious what the fuel will end up costing. You'll have to generate all the energy that the fuel will hold as chemical energy and then some for inefficiencies, but Elon's vertical integration will probably make it pretty efficient Arguably, the price of methane on the open market is already too low. It's essentially a waste product of oil drilling and converting CO2 into CH4 will do no good for the planet.    Far better to reduce the demand for oil (by, I don't know, founding a company to sell electric cars?) and stimulate demand for methane by buying it on the open market. Anybody know where the job posting is located? Im having trouble locating it on their website Musk is changing the world but people shit on him. They love Greta who has done nothing but hate Elon. Okay but we literally just burn methane coming off of landfills in a lot of cases atm  What if we captured that instead haha \\&gt;Please join if interested.  Meaning what? Sign me up. There are chemicals that absorb CO2 from air very effectively. As I remember they then give up the CO2 when heated. It's been many years since I watched a video of how it's done, so I don't remember. They then used the CO2 and hydrogen separated from water to make methanol to fuel autos. The whole process could be powered by solar panels in a sunny climate. The whole process could be carbon neutral. No lithium batteries which turn into toxic waste after 15 years or so. They are pretty much gonna have to power this with nuclear on mars right? How are they powering it here on earth? A carbon-neutral LCH4 plant? Well, if anyone can do it, it's this lot! Ideally, the system would capture source air with higher than average levels of CO2. Off the top of my head, good candidates would be livestock farms and commercial office buildings with exhaust systems. There are products like enverid's air scrubber that removes CO2 from the air. Oh wow  How to turn air into a block of ice .... We better start producing more CO2. Didn't Elon laugh in the face of a German politician for talking about Power2Gas? lol.. Gas is an energy storage and while it's efficiency is not as good as that of batteries, the containers are much simpler especially on a big scale. In Germany we pump water up a mountain if we have to much energy to let it flow back down during peak hours. Could be an alternative for that as well! They could use surplus boring machines to drill storage for CO2. Nice idea  Searching for a related job post.        Interested to know what is the current team looks like. Every oil company had a ""clean"" publicity stunt program. Not saying this is it, just that ""starting a green program"" it\'s not something to be excited about. Everyone who has worked with any organic chemistry doing instrument knows this will be a huge task and will take a lot of smoked brains to reach completion.  I mean, there are so many science groups looking into a more viable way of producing CH4 from CO2, so I somehow doubt SpaceX will invent something new and rather build a machine using e.g. the Sabatier reaction, which is already commercially used to produce synthetic natural gas. But this requires so much care and maintenance.  I really hope they can do it, but don't get too hyped. Maybe they should just found a company that focuses on this task solely, so SpaceX can focus on RaptorV2 and Starship. Maybe just hire an already existing company or ask them for a joint project.    It feels like Elon wants a little too much. That is an old "" why should you buy an ev in this dirty grid"" argument. I wonder if methane could be a viable alternative fuel for the airline industry - assuming of course that it could be extracted from the atmosphere or by some other carbon-neutral means. What are they processing it into specifically?",1173,"""...take CO2 out of the atmosphere and then put it right back when we launch the rocket""  FTFY, Elon.  Like, It\'s great that rocket fuel won\'t need to be made from dinos anymore but this is going to be carbon neutral at best until they\'re actually transporting fuel off world. When will SpaceX finally go public! This sounds a bit dangerous, no? How about okay, but put someone else in leadership that can actually do something CO2 gets absorbed by water, where the diatoms live. They are phytoplankton that convert carbon dioxide in the water into oxygen. Diatoms play a important part of the energy and nutrient cycles of water resources. Diatoms produce up tp 40% of the oxygen we breath. They live by converting  CO2, water, and energy from light into sugar for food. If we take away part of the CO2 what will happen to the diatoms/ oxygen we breath? Dont tell us show us. Until theres solid progress, Im not buying it Elon Musk: not the world's smartest man. What sucks is that this is going to drastically increase the carbon footprint of starship.  Almost 70% of power on the ERCOT grid comes from fossil, generally at an efficiency of \\~50%.  Then there are transmission losses, and then there is the efficiency of the carbon capture and methane making process.  All said and done, they are going to burn three or four times more methane and coal to make the fuel than they would have used to just put existing fossil methane directly into starship.  It's going to take a lot of power to make starship-quantities of methane.  We're talking tens or hundreds of megawatts.  Even in sunny TX, they'd need a solar farm that spans **many** square miles to power a carbon capture methane plant that could support anything more than a trivial flight rate. Is this a project for before or after they go bankrupt? Or is this a plan to get more funding to avoid that? Thumbnail looks like what my wife wish I had it looks like my uncle's Ok so, how the fuck is that going to work and wouldn't that actually be kinda counter productive? Hope he can clean up his own mess of 300tons of carbon dioxide being sent into the atmosphere from rocket launches. He is amazing at turning things around, I hope he can make this program up and running. I'm sure it will help even our own carbon footprint someday. There are already a couple of companies working on doing this now. One has raised a ton of money already. SpaceX is a bit late to the game.

Maybe SpaceX can win this prizemoney after all  :)  Seriously, this is really win-win. Tech needed for Mars anyway, less controversy with natural gas. Hope it works. So SpaceX finally getting serious about building those Sabatier-based propellant plants?  I wonder whether they\'ll run with current state of the art, focussing on simplifying the equipment and making it able to run autonomously for years, or whether they\'re chasing new designs with bleeding edge chemistry and materials science?  If I had unlimited funds but limited people I\'d probably try a two-pronged approach, one team simply focussing on squishing contemporary technology into a containerised system, with electricity and ambient air as inputs with liquid methane and liquid oxygen as outputs. Then a second team focussing on acquiring or developing technology to make contemporary techniques more efficient (eg: better catalysts for a Sabatier reaction) or to develop something new to replace the sabatier reactor since there\'s an easier way to handle the reactions given the desired inputs and outputs.  I guess this would really be a ""commercialisation"" team and an ""experimental technologies"" team. Am I wrong for thinking most of that CO2 will be dumped back into the atmosphere on launch? Is this the first instance of Elon talking about ISRU? That's one of those hot button issues that are easy to point to when trying to discredit the SpaceX Mars strategy. I think space radiation is another one. There are a number of things that SpaceX might leave to others to address on Mars (large scale power generation, housing, science goals), but this is one that SpaceX must address themselves in order for the Mars architecture to be sound. sabatier plants are really not that hard (chemical engineer here) but the problem is that you need to design *for a specific environment* and with several restrictions   first that comes to mind is the reaction rate... sabatier on earth is performed as gaseous reaction, over a rhodium catalyst bed (you don\'t really need rhodium, coud be pretty much any commercial catalyst and the reaction rate would still be immensely better than 0 catalyst) which introduces the problem of having to prepare it   in chemical industry it\'s standard to prepare and recycle catalyst, it ""re activates"" them... that step is another failure point, it has to go away    elon has talked about electrochemical catalysis, but that is very problematic, you basically don\'t run electrochemical reactions on gasses, too small production rate... so it is imperative to run it as liquid   now, on Martian conditions its pretty feasible to run the electrolysis having CO2 as a liquid, and bubbling H2 close to the electrode for the reaction to occur, but it still implies that water will be formed, which will solidify as ice (I have personal experience with cryogenic electrolisis of ammonia, and water tends to nucleate on the electrode, rendering it almost non conductive)    so I think it\'s pretty safe to assume that electrolysis is only for obtaining hydrogen gas (liquifying it serves no purpose, just produce it as you use it)    running the reaction under cryogenics is ruled out, activation energy is a thing (darn it)    so we conclude we still need to run CO2 and H2 at a somewhat high temperature (relative to martian ambient)    something has to be used as an heterogeneous catalyst, if not too many side reactions, very low reaction rate, unsustainable for methane production    my take is that they will develop some zeolite impregnated with the catalyst, or directly as part of the crystalline structure, that is easily prepared here on earth with no real need of human interaction (yes, I have made dozens of different zeolites, it\'s dumb cheap and dumb easy to prepare, not so much to develop tho)    I don\'t see them having any trouble obtaining CO2 or water, stupidly easy to separate from both atmosphere and as ice from soil (and we WANT that, the more dumbly easy the more flexibility you get)   CO2 from liquifying martian air, then distillation for only CO2 fraction (just flash or something, it seems like the easiest, but honestly there are just so many ways I would consider it a no brainer)   water is even more easy, the difficult part is mine it/dig it from soil, the separation is just.... heat it up, have it evaporate to gas, the rock won\'t melt    anyways, sorry for the long take It's a good idea, SpaceX doesn't have to spend billions towards this effort but at least they're doing more than their competitors. it is very interesting for earth, but hardly a challenge for martian conditions   take air, liquify it, distill the CO2.... done...  moreover, martian atmosphere contains nitrogen (N2) so that wonderfully useful elements that you gain too   for water is more of the same (water because you want hydrogens to attach to those sweet carbons), actually, way easier... the incredibly complex part is actually getting to obtain said water from soil, but once you have the soil.... just heat it up and collect the water vapor, use it for reactions as you please... electrolysis gives you hydrogen gas, use it for reactions too   the problem is earth, not so easy to get CO2 out of atmosphere, and hydrogen is pretty wasteful to get from anything that isn't reformation of natural gas.... which if you have, why the hell not using it as is Earth atmosphere is not too suitable for Sabatier. Not enough CO2. Extracting CO2 going to be really expensive, unless they are going small scale using CO2 they getting as byproduct of LOX farm.

Which atmosphere? I mean it'll be needed for Mars, but would also be useful for Earth. What planet was he planning on doing it on? It's unclear. Now there's money to be made from removing Co2 from the atmosphere,watch how many naysayers get on board. I don't get it. Carbon dioxide is 0.04% of the atmosphere, so probably a lot of power needed to extract it in massive quantity. The hydrogen required for the Sabatier process is more feasibly extracted from hydrocarbons than from water, but a lot of power required either way.....  This seems to fly in the face of Elon's long held view that the hydrogen economy is a daft idea. What would be super cool is if SpaceX could develop a hybrid engine that could run on both methane her on Earth, and on Mars it would run on carbon monoxide.  Although not as good of a fuel as CH4, CO would have the advantage of being extremely simple to produce on Mars (crack the CO2 in the Martian atmosphere to CO and O2), compared to creating methane.  One advantage off the top of my head is that you wouldn't need a source of hydrogen (IE water) when manufacturing CO, but you would need that for methane.  So if Starship happens to land in a spot with no water ice, it might not be able to refuel. Was I in the military too long or does this shape look a bit phalic? Is the tweet just saying join SpaceX, or is he starting a new company specifically for carbon capture methane? I never thought Id get to say this, especially with so many people smarter than me here, [but I totally called this!]( And I couldnt be happier. Yeah ok, how do we join? There was no link provided Duuude that sounds really interesting! &gt; Please join if interested.  How? Anyone have a link to any positions?

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/teslamotors) if you have any questions or concerns.* From the article: Elon Musk has confirmed on Twitter that his 2021 tax bill will be around $11 billion, thanks to his sale of Tesla stock this year. This amount may not be enough to satisfy the CEOs staunchest critics, but $11 billion is no joke. It does equate, after all, to Elon Musk paying over $1.5 million worth of taxes for every day since he became a US citizen in 2002 or about $1 million worth of taxes per day since he started studying business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania way back in 1992.   Musks estimate for his 2021 taxes is in line with expectations from agencies such as CNBC, which noted that the CEO had already paid $7 billion in state and federal taxes this year, with about $5 billion more expected to be paid by January 1, 2022. The news agency noted that the figures could represent the single tax bill ever, thanks in part to Musks combined tax rate of 53%.",2,,0

(Yes, but if we find unexpected bugs, release might be delayed until 24th) If weve learned anything on this long strange trip its to not trust Elons ETA.  In before ____ maybe, _____ definitely. I've got a couple of issues that I am hoping this will fix.  1. Format USB does not create the TeslaCam folder. Therefore, dash cam and sentry do not work until you create the folder using a computer. 2. Steering wheel has a good amount of play when I wiggle back and forth.  I noticed this last week when I got my car back from service. Could be a mechanical issue but I also updated the the latest FSD Beta on the same day. Just got mine pushed to my Model Y a couple minutes ago! Its coming people! Friday came and went. It became Tuesday.   Tuesday came and went. It became Thursday evening.  When Thursday comes and goes, it's not important to think about when the next date is announced and probably missed. It's important to remember: if he'd said absolutely fucking nothing, you'd be no worse for the wear, and when it did arrive, you'd be pleasantly surprised. With every Tweet, he reinforces his own inability to deliver ANYTHING software related. Dont worry, it would be late as usual. Lets enjoy our holiday. I wonder what that tweet was about It is today evening, were my holiday Elon! New to Tesla ownership (mid Oct). I had an update today, and the FSD beta video that I leave up on the screen (I don't have fsd) seem more robust but I see no indication of the christmas update? How can I tell?

Sell out all current MY first like they did with Model S before the start of updated MY? Quarterly pushes are a thing of the past. I had a VIN assigned December 8th for a MYLR and it just disappeared today So still waiting to see those deliveries  This gives me hope. My wife and I have been waiting for what seems like for ever.. Had Feb delivery date on my X, received it today. Wonder if some people will still defer in hopes of the BBB revival This Bullish or... can't tell... hmm And forego the tax credit? I had Dec 16-31 up until 3 days ago, now my MYP range is Jan 23- Feb 20 :-/ Wish I would get my S this year. Ordered a Model Y long range Nov 16. Was given a delivery date of June. Picked up the car today!!?!?  Thankfully we could get out of our current lease early as the dealership needed inventory. Get mine tomorrow! Placed my order july 1st and still waiting for my MY.  Original EDD was Oct when I put down my order frustrating Working hard to get cars delivered in the SoCal area! Happy holidays all. :) As of 12/15 my delivery date was 12/29 - 12/31... I checked my delivery date again today and it got delayed to March - April 2022.. wtf??? Can someone explain?? Sorry but Im buying a car, not giving support to the richest car company and person in the world. Delaying until next year in case BBB passes, thanks. If there is any chance at BBB passing youd be fools to not wait until the new year. $8-10k on the table. My new model S LR EDD has been pushed to Mar-Apr and I ordered 6 months ago. This is BS and model s non plaid owners are getting absolutely screwed. I mean I been waiting since June for my Y and will gladly pick one up Edd was Jan 1-29, 2022.  Now moved up to Dec 28-31. Od 8/8. Doesnt this contradict his memo from like a month ago telling his staff to focus on quality and not rush things for quarter end or year end. Yep!!! Had a model 3 with delivery in Feb, it moved up to tomorrow!!! So excited!!! When I ordered I was originally supposed to get it in December.. its now saying June I have a EDD for MYLR Jan-feb.  I texted my SA a week ago for an update and he replied that theyre trying to get my car to me by the end of the year Anyone getting their M3LR with delivery scheduled for February? Asking for a friend lol you're welcome Est. Jan-Feb delivery on my m3 LR blue/white interior. Still waiting. Ordered my X January 21. Delivery April. Then June. Then Aug. Then Oct. Then a Vin # and delivery date of Dec 21st!! Yay!! Finally!!. Then it disappeared. Now February. I have really lost my sense of humor. Had a June delivery date on my Y and suddenly it is ready last week. I ordered it three weeks ago and I have no choice but to put it on hold :( Bruh my delivery is March-April  Got a call to take delivery now for Model Y not scheduled until June! I deferred (was counting on time to save for down payment). They said I will have to take delivery by Feb 22nd or they will cancel. My Model Y Performance was scheduled for February delivery and I took delivery about a week ago! Huge shoutout to the Tesla team. After contacting Tesla they assigned me a new VIN the day after and now I have a delivery date! Such a quick turnaround, Tesla team must be pushing deliveries hard during the holidays! Ugh! I bought my Model Y in September, had a date originally in February, then March-April, then recently it dropped to Dec 21-31, and now its back to march-April. Im getting nothing before EOY :(.",279,Now pay your employees living wages and give them safe working conditions,5

Great work by SpaceXengine/test team!. Like Id it 268.9 or over 300? How does this compare to Merlin engines, is this ""good?"" or an advancement on raptor 1? Really interesting information on Raptor performance that Musk gave Lex Fridman during his third interview.  According to Musk, the main figure of merit is main chamber pressure, which directly affects performance and how hard it is to achieve and maintain these pressures.  I believe he said 300 bar was the minimum needed to get to Mars efficiently. Sounds good, i'll take 4000 of them.  -Elon Pretty impressive considering ~5 weeks ago it was all hands on deck Thanksgiving weekend [to recover from a disaster]( How does this compare to the Rocketlab Archimedes engine that claims to be a low pressure engine to reduce wear on the engine parts and make reuse easier?  Is efficient engines more important for Mars travel than to earth orbit? if faa continues the current pace of the approval process maybe raptor 1 won't see space at all Interesting....I wish we could learn about what changed in the engine's design or materials that allowed it to hit such high pressures. Wow, that is an amazing achievement 4,200 psi? Call it 420 deci psi.  I'm thinking of those videos where someone slashed a semi tire and it took off their clothes and knocked them down, that's ~100 psi. 300 bar of angry gases is crazy.

Why? For level 2 it's kinda lame. Good lord. 12k for an unstable beta? Ridiculous.   Edit: hahahahaha this was reported so many times by some actual adult children that the auto mod removed it  For what? A horrible experience where you have to disengage every minute? Anyone else think its kind of crazy that they keep raising the price on a feature that hasnt been released yet?   Also anybody know if I add it to my order today if I can remove it after VIN assigned if I want to? Thats a bit rich for its current state 12K?!  WTF, this shit better come out of beta....and from what ive seen online its not even close to coming out beta.....hope i'm wrong, still waiting to get the FSD feature (turning on city streets) i paid for 2+ years ago.  Yes i know, but i cant get a safety score less than 90, because 2 other people drive our Tesla and they both have lead foots. If I can get a refund on the $5k I paid back in 2019 I would. I feel they would sell a lot more if FSD was tied to the account and not the vehicle just my two cents. Counter-offer: -$12K Simple solution: dont buy it. Not worth it at 12k. ""Buy in now, or be priced out forever!"" The clientele paying 10k dont care about the extra 2k is his logic guaranteed .  With such a waitlist they will say  hey we got one available with FSD if you want  and many people will say ok Lmaoo Enhanced Autopilot returning when? Lol.  Pass If its level 5 sure Ill pay 12k if not Im not funding his research lol This is now $10k too high.  I have zero regrets about getting EAP back in my 2018 Model 3. Its a shame people cant get that anymore. As a ""true believer"" who annoys the crap out of my passengers by using this feature in beta, for whatever reason this gives me a lot of (irrational?) anger.  1. Buy it and you can\'t even use it, unless you go through tremendous contortions to get into the beta. 2. Buy it and sell your car to buy a newer Tesla because you like the experience? SOL. You have to buy it again at a newer price because why would you ever get credit for it? 3. It\'s not actually very useful in its current state. (This is speaking as someone who has used the FSD beta for nearly 10,000 miles.) You\'re babysitting the car. It\'s not freeing up mental horsepower while driving. You\'re scanning the road making sure your car doesn\'t commit vehicular manslaughter on your behalf much of the time.  I love the idea. I want the product to succeed. But at this point, rising prices are just egregious without some sort of plan at Tesla to pacify early-adopter true-believers who have given the widows mite.  The features that _are_ easy and useful? I was shocked to discover that adaptive cruise control and lane keeping are _standard_ for many newer cars. Seriously. WTF. It's almost like the price of FSD is pegged to Tesla MSRP inflation! I wish theyd release EAP again or just give the features to those with standard Autopilot. We shouldnt have to pay $12k or $199/mo for green light chimes and auto lane changes  HW4 incoming? got our tesla when it was 5k, then it went up to 8k i think, then 10k. Friends that bought the package when they first got the car all regrets it Take rate just went from 10% down to 2%  What are they thinking over there? I bought FSD for 2k for my 2018 P3D- when they were having their fire sale a few years ago.  I love it when the price goes up. Offsets depreciation. Lol not worth it! FSD is a pipe dream and a literal scam to anyone buying a Tesla. Change My Mind:  The current FSD rolling out to customers is a corporate liability.  I love the passion here, and Elon's willingness to push this. The progress they've made in data analysis, image recognition, and all the vision work they've done is astounding. Maybe they'll crack this. When they do, I'll be the first standing in line. Why not raise it to $50K elon ? Ima be pissed to if they raise the price of acceleration boost and/or the monthly FSD subscription, too. $12k is asinine for the feature as it exists today. Incredible. Absolute insanity. And its not even tied to your account when you upgrade vehicles  What in the F is this guy smoking?  I love my M3 and love FSD beta (with the flaws).  Paid 3k and would not pay a dime over 5k. Better to get 12 Tsla stocks for that much. It's wasn't attractive to me at $5000... Are FSD price increases historically tied to major improvements? Price   Sales   Usefulness  For the love of God stop buying it people! It isn't even worth half its current price and the only reason they keep raising the price is they keep finding enough suckers to pay for it... I saw this coming and I\'m still kind of gobsmacked. At this point I honestly feel like they\'re trying to dissuade people from buying it up front so they limit their exposure to further instances of people buying a car with FSD and then selling it or upgrading before ever seeing it reach its full potential (and not being able to transfer the license).  I imagine they\'d rather most folks go the subscription route, and leave the one-time full-access buyout as something for the whales and ""true believers"".   Not that I think they won\'t eventually solve it, but I definitely don\'t see them actualizing the robo-fleet fantasy inside of this decade, and that\'s their value proposition to justify the cost. More money for junk. No thanks. I suspect they know the current hardware will need to be replaced for true full self drive, so they dont want to sell it cheap. It need to cover the future retrofit cost. Subscription will remain $199 until FSD beta is wide release Does it work with snow covered roads? If not, hard pass at even $1000. The joke is on all of us at this point. It's upsetting.  It barely works on my M3 and I want to get a Cybertruck in the future. However, I probably won't buy anything else from Tesla until there's some kind of transferability. Elon says level 4 by end of 2022 then tries to raise FSD price. This seems familiar Not gonna lie, pretty happy I (accidentally) avoided this EAP/FSD debacle with my V1 AP purchase. Cannot imagine purchasing FSD for the foreseeable future. If the current beta was rocking it like a champ and blowing everyones mind with autonomy then *maybe*. I was running the beta for a good while before deciding to remove it and cancelling my subscription.   This tech is FAR from being worth a purchase. What idiots are still buying FSD?  Its not ready and wont be for years.  I think they will just change the goal posts and call it delivered at some point.  If it remains a driver assist feature its not worth but a few grand at max. Fan of Tesla. Not a fan of FSD. Ive been amazed at the amount of time that they have been able to sell something which doesnt exist. Even more impressive has been their ability to keep charging more for it despite the fact that it doesnt exist. Some of the early adopters dont even have their cars anymore. They literally paid for something they never received. I swear he just double downs and each time it gets worse. FSD is literally the worst feature that Tesla could offer at this stage. If anything they should be embarrassed at how bad it is.    No I am not impressed.        * I am embarrassed by it so much I only show it off to people who ask after many disclaimers    * I fear road raging anyone behind me I turn it off as I don't want to be accused of brake checking them     * I have yet to make a three and half mile journey to Publix in one direction of the one four miles in the otr direction yet without it failing. The four mile one doesn't even have a light! V11 single stack soon then? And/or HW4 with the new HD Cameras That's crazy for a feature that isn't even ready and we have no timeline for when it will be ready. Their uptake has to be horrendous. I think it was $6k when we bought our model 3.  At this point it was not a great value.  I don't think I'll buy it on our next car (probably a cybertruck) unless it actually does something more than green light chimes and lane changes with turn signals.  So far not worth it, as much as I wish it weren't true. Could I please have my FSD I bought for 2 cars for 8K each 4 years ago? I paid $5k for enhanced autopilot when it was being marketed as FSD in 2018. Totally regret it. I was mislead and I never use it. Ill never pay for FSD. Good guy Elon, it's so bad that he doesn't want anyone to buy it.  For those that have or want FSD, what is the primary reason? Do you just hate driving or is it just for inching forward in highway traffic? It's not like you can read a book or take your eyes completely off the road. That requires at least level 4 if not level 5, and currently, it's at level 3. Level 4 or 5 is still many years away, like maybe 2030 at the earliest. I just want the phantom breaking on normal AP to end FSD may turn out to be Teslas biggest blunder. AP is outstanding (with radar). FSD is near worthless. Don't buy it! I'm tired of Elon's fear-of-missing-out strategy.  It's a disgusting way to solicit sales for tech that isn't nearly worth the price, and will likely never be worth that price over the lifespan of cars that purchase it now. They should allow transfer at that price point. That should remove the anxiety of needing to buy FSD over and over again (at higher price) when buying new Teslas, like 'forever stamp.' You know, other companies pay their employees to test their autonomous vehicles If the subscription stays $200 it'll be cheaper to just have it if you trade out your car every 5 years. What's the average ownership of a tesla owner? Personally I barely keep cars for 2 years. Valve is probably kicking themselves:  * Half-Life 3 is coming!  Preorder for $50 * Half-Life 3 is still coming! Preorder for $75 * Half-Life 3 has a playable tech preview!  Preorder for $125 * Half-Life 3 is in alpha!  Preorder for $175 * Half-Life 3 is delayed!  Preorder for $250 * Half-Life 3 is almost here!  Preorder for $350 * Half-Life 3 is delayed again! Preorder for $500 It's not worth the 5000 I paid for it 2 years ago LOL at this point, I am not sure how Tesla get away with this. Imo the price continuing to rise is a clear sign that they have hardware changes coming that will need to retrofit onto old cars. This will help them afford it or at least turn people off from buying it so they don't need to pay for these retrofits. So the tech that didnt work at $10k now costs $12k. Makes sense. I don't think FSD is achievable with the current technology. I don't think ML/NN can make a fully autonomous vehicle. Paying 12k $ for a future promised product which in all likely never gonna happen seems a bad decision.  ridiculous An even bigger waste of money! Will the price just increase $2k with every second or so update? It would have to be $4,000 at most and account-bound. Seriously. Is he just trying to drive TSLA down?  It appears to be working. i have a 2018 model 3 with EAP. back then they were trying to milk an extra $2500 out of me for the EAP-&gt;FSD upgrade, and it wasn't even worth it it at that time. 12k? looooool. Not worth even at current price. I didnt even buy EAP back in the day after phantom braking scared the shit out of me on the highway during a trial period.  Still driving myself everywhere since 2018, no regrets.  For the record, I absolutely love driving the car.  Its a pleasure on long or short drives. I leased a 2019 model 3 and really struggled whether or not to add the FSD at $7K, so glad I didn't, what a waste of money that would have been from what I hear about how well it works.  at $10 or $12K it's not even a consideration for the Y that I have on order to replace the 3 [Best I can do is 20 bucks]( .yikes.  It isnt even worth $200 yet.  Basically useless. Tesla should honestly be embarrassed that this feature is being used at all. Cant wait for my car to fully self drive me on Jan 17th then! Im rising the price of a Time Travel Machine Im building to $25k on Jan 17 There is no possible way this will incentivse me to buy FSD at 10k, I like my model Y, it's been clear for the last 5 years this technology is not ready and, they are asking people to pay the price of a used corolla to be beta testers. I love my Model Y, but suck balls, Elon. I subscribed for 5 months and it was a huge waste. Ha, jokes on him, Ive paid $20k already and have yet to receive it.   &lt;sad trombone&gt; Its actually genius. Keep raising the price so everyone who bought it at the price before feels good about getting their moneys worth. /s [FSD take rate has been in constant decline since 2019.]( How can they think this will help? Wow! I bought FSD back in 2019. I wish I wish I could sell it somehow now. Itd be my best ROI of all my investments! Funny. It is not worth the $7k or $8k I paid for it back in the day. I mean I already spent $10k AUD on Enhanced Autopilot back in the day. This doesn't seem too different. Not that I would buy it though. Waste of money. Maybe in 10 years when it's not a beta test This feels like FSD price is Tesla's way to charge markup to customers. With every price hike on FSD, the subscription model becomes more and more enticing to potential buyers ![gif](giphy|fXnRObM8Q0RkOmR5nf) How much to get the old UI back? I really feel like everyone who paid for FSD should be given free supercharging, premium connectivity and/ or acceleration boost until they actually deliver on the product promised. Best I can do is 3.50 Good! Keep making it more and more expensive so people refuse to buy it. Its a waste of money, especially being non transferable to another future Tesla. LOL no. Tie it to the account not the car lower to 5k. It wasn't worth the $8000 I paid for it and I saw none of that on resale. I'm literally laughing my ass off on why they're increasing the price for something that hasn't improved. I've purchased my model 3 with FSD and it hasn't changed much to be worth 12k, let alone 10k. And I will continue to not buy it. Even more now.  First day line waiter, I dont even have ACC. Refused to pay $3k for something that should have never been an option on a $45k car.   I once got a rental Corolla that had ACC and lane keep. Teslas greed never ends. $12k now and i'm still waiting for FSD beta but my score is 97 and some guy that had like 43 with tons of money gets FSD Beta. WTF?!@#! Wish I could sell it for that :\\\\ Normal FREE AP doesnt even work well . This is a complete joke but \u200d. Hahahhes serioushahaha  Seriously, FSD is shit in that its still Beta, wonky AF per the many videos and it should not be fetching a higher price per se.   I wont buying another Telsa with it, not worth the risk. I will upgrade into Plaid (when supply improves) w/o FSD. $12k can spent on a good wrap, wheels or a ceramic break kit. Damn. All I can say is what a scam. The worse it gets the more he charges.    Suckers. Even their subscription service will go up once FSD goes public. Pass. Def not worth it at this point. Ill take EAP in a heartbeat though. Mooning on Monday boys! For $12k I can hire my own chauffeur. Wow, hes raising the price of something thats gotten worse!  capitalism! Maybe instead of hiring more accountants to figure out new pricing schemes they should hire more engineers to fix the problems with the cars. Fix the wipers or the high beams first you idiot does this mean wide release on jan 17? Imagine paying for FSD for many, many years now and it still isn't even available to use.  How has there not been a class action lawsuit over this BS?? This price increase isnt to panic sell FSD now, or later. Their intent is to not sell FSD at all, and move to a subscription model only. FSD was not worth it @ 6k... at 12k is just a cash grab and a joke.  Maybe if it was tied to my account, I would've bought it at 6k when I had the chance.  In my opinion current hardware configuration will never achieve FSD, I feel like the car needs more cameras for better coverage and potentially more sensors. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Subscribed for a month, got FSD beta, dont see why anybody would want it. Turned it off with 10 days left in subscription. Someone else mentioned that lane change on signal and green light chime only thing worth having. Otherwise its stressful and dangerous. Lol at the 23,000 simps who loved this tweet on Twitter. I mean, they could always:  -\tTie it to the owner, not the car.  -\tPart it out into EAP and FSD again.  I think there are *a lot* of people who would shell out $5K for EAP but dont want to drop $10K+ on FSD. Ill give Elon three fiddy for it. Is it coming out of beta Jan 17th!?!??  Eh... I got a Model Y recently, and canceled the FSD purchase at the last minute. I'm going to keep resisting the FOMO and let this price increase go by (giving that 10 days notice really feels like they are trying to cause a rush of sales before the 17th).  &amp;#x200B;  Paying that much to be a beta tester is just nutty. And I just can't believe that they will keep making it more and more expensive. As their FSD starts to improve, and more competition starts coming in, they are not going to be able to justify their FSD option increasing the price of their cars by $20k.  &amp;#x200B;  We'll see, I guess. If it gets a whole lot better a couple months from now, and the price keeps climbing, I suppose I'll have some regrets. I just wish I could get FSD beta, considering I paid $8k over a year ago...  Auto steer on city streets ""later this year"" \\[shoots coffee out nose\\]  I'm sorry, what? It was priced about $9,999 too high \\*already\\*.. Its not worth the $7k many have paid. IMO Next thing you know they'll make the UI shit...oh wait... How much pot is he smoking now? lol Elon's lost it Pay me $10k and I'll wildly spin your steering wheel and turn right when the in-car nav says FSD should go left, followed by rapid acceleration and disregard for cones. There, I just saved you $2k. Hahahahahahahaha yea no thanks. After V11 mess and removing radars they increase the price? Fix the phantom brakes you greedy .. I wont pay 10k now, why would I pay 12K? Lol I bought it for $10k on my current Model X. My next one (May, 2023) I'll just get the subscription unless something significant changes. 12k so you can move your car in a parking lot, or have the car curb itself! The deal keeps getting better! No way! A frame shift drive in a car? Absurd price software toggle I paid for it in 2018 and I still don't even fucking have it. Nah Can I please just buy lane change while on autopilot? I truly dont understand this.  EAP is AMAZING - an absolute godsend in bumper to bumper traffic and long road trips.  With that in the portfolio, Ive never understood the focus on FSD.  I get that folks have spent thousands (each) over the years for it, so they have to deliver on those commitments.  But from the start, who was clamoring for the capability?  Why oversell this when you had an outstanding, albeit scaled down, capability being delivered??  Im sure theyll eventually figure it out and itll be a game changer -  but the way theyve handled this middle ground confuses the hell out of me Will wait for some used model when the used car market settles down in a few years maybe Not worth it at all But why?  What value have they added? Hahaha i would buy FSD now but I already locked in the price for CyberTruck.... FUCK I would return it at 7000 if they would allow it. Completely useless. Elon: Here have FSD my loyal, paying customer.  Also Elon: Actually no, youre not qualified cuz u braked too hard for a pigeon 2 days ago. I would pay Elon Musk $12k to be able to turn off the horrible adaptive cruise control, phantom brakes and changing of the set autopilot speed at every cloverleaf and give me regular cruise control. HAHAHahahahahahahahah   hahahahahahahaha     elon is so wrong about this. It's cool and all, but I'm not seeing the practical daily use. I sure as shit won't let it drive strangers around for money either. I think auto pilot is good enough. Thing I will never buy Is this a sign that they will need to upgrade more in the fleet than anticipated? I've heard rumors (not from anywhere credible) that the AP HW4 computer will be needed to get there. They are already going to upgrade the older Model S/X cameras, but so far it seems they are going to the Model 3/Y cameras. If they do need HW4 for reach level 4/5, then it would be included for free with everyone who already bought it. The price increase could be (partly) to offset this. Im just going to download in Limewire I wonder if Tesla is shooting themselves in the foot. Ive been planning to buy a Model Y for a few years now, just waiting to pay off my wifes car first. FSD was one of the main things that drew me to Tesla, but they are pricing me out now, so if Im just going to get the basic adaptive cruise and lane keep assist, Im going to be shopping other less advanced electric cars and may not even get a Tesla. My theory is that the original $3k through $6k original FSD price covered the development costs. $10k covered the HW3 upgrade for some. $12k will cover HW4 related costs for Tesla. FSD is utter garbage at this point, honestly think we'll be waiting until the 2030s before it's really usable. I paid for this thing and haven't got a sniff of the beta.  I'm not sure why I did it.  I don't even get a discount on the monthly Internet fee nor charging or anything.  You'd think there would be some kind of benefit while we wait as investors in a still be be released feature. I feel like raising price wont help sell. Should probably leave price same and lower monthly cost if they want more money. Drop the one time price thing. It used to be 4,000 \u200d\u200d At this rate of arbitrary prices hikes the car will be given away for free before FSD is finalized. Did he go on Rogan again? Who the fuck is buying this garbage? I wanted to buy when it was 7k but didnt have money for a tesla. Now that I have money for a tesla I dont have money for fsd. Between all the price increases this year and the fact that I plan on getting the acceleration boost theres no way o could convince my wife to let me drop 12k on this. As a shareholder I think the pricing in this one s wrong. Delusional But this makes your car future proof right? They already upgraded cars to 3.0 to be compatible with FSD. Damn so an extra 2k. People will def buy to lock in their cars now It wasn't worth 7k when I bought my car, isn't worth 10k now, and won't be worth 12k any time soon unless FSD suddenly comes out of beta, smart summon becomes perfect, and a bunch of new features are added.   I honestly think they're just stealing money from buyers that are excited and don't know what they're getting for the money.  God I wish I could just buy auto lane change though. They should honestly just make it so we could add cameras to current car that aren't Tesla and buy FSD. It's all vision anyways so it can be done like Comma AI. Still beyond me that it's going to cost 1/3 of the price of a base Model 3. Gotta pay that 4B tax bill somehow Anyone get a vin assigned recently for their model 3? Trying to figure out when I should be expecting mine that I ordered back in early September I'm generally a huge fan of Elon's companies and goals. That being said, you pay $12k and you volunteer your time to beta-test this software and make it better? Elon should be giving discounts, not charging. I cant believe they havent been sued already. This just smells like a class action lawsuit. Can you add FSD later on without missing any features. Meaning Id you dont get it at sale is their any negative to not having it at sale. Pssh. Go ahead, keep raising it. There's zero chance I'm ever jumping back on this bandwagon. Bought FSD in 2017 for our MX, still have zero sign of it now in 2022, 5 years later.  Whatever the price is when it IS released, the market will quickly determine if it's worth it. If it's worth more than $12k, I'll gladly pay it with a new Tesla. But if not, I'm not going to pre-order this game this time. What a clown shoes move. FSD is garbage. To anybody reading this that's considering buying it, DON'T! As of now (and, frankly, the foreseeable future) it's unusable and an absolute waste of money.  Maybe they should prove that it's actually useful before doing stunts like this. You know, actually deliver on even a fraction of what was promised to buyers 3 years ago. I feel like they want to push people to subscription per month vs buying outright.   Complaints well just unsubscribe to it, too expensive? Subscription vs buying it. Elon is poor. Help feed Elon. $2,000 for basic auto pilot - coming this summer!  this shit aint even worth 1k let alone 12k Jesus, look if we could tie FSD to my account that would be one thing, but tying it to my car that could get T boned tomorrow by some idiot just doesnt make sense. I can buy a complete used car for $12K. GTFO. This is like Apple's $400 castor wheels or Toyota charging a subscription for remote start. It;s because they want more money. It has zero to do with what it's worth.   Let's look at it from a different angle. I spend about $1200 a year on gas. That's ten fucking years worth of gas. GTFO. What are we paying for? I dont know, but the price is going up! Sweet! Sign me up!  bought FSD in 2018. still waiting for it. Any day now, right? lol, what is he smoking this time? The more Ive seen of FSD, the worse my perception of it has become. I dont see it making any significant progress, and it has a very long way to go to be close to a state Id consider usable. I dont think itll even get there with the current hardware, to be honest. But good for Musk/Tesla, I guess, if they can convince people to fork over $12k for it. It was already a hard no for me at $10k, so they arent losing a sale to me at either level. I just find it comically overpriced now. How did FSD regress to being the worst in the industry, after a 3+ years head start? I think Elon must be running some sort of social experiment with this. Theres no way he actually believes hes pulling a FOMO demand lever. Why? It doesnt work Yeah no thanks,  love Tesla and Elon and my model 3, but no way!  Ive said since long before I actually got my car that theyre way too focused on FSD  They make the greatest electric cars in the world (for now ) but so much effort into self driving I think will eventually erode their market share /dominance in the category (once someone rolls out a competitive charging network ) I kinda disagree with a lot of comments in this thread, even though I might be very wrong since I havent purchased FSD myself :  -\tI ABSOLUTELY agree with the fact that FSD not carrying over to new teslas is completely insane  -\tI agree with the objection that purchasing FSD, for what I understand, Makes no sense  if the true experience is hidden behind a beta skill rating wall   BUT  -\tI think pure vision is the way to go, at least it should be the main info intake of autopilot. Plus I see no reason why current camera hardware shouldnt be enough. Honestly people saying pure vision is trash must really have great credentials of work and experience in the field if Tesla engineers think otherwise . Ive even seen someone mention Waymo, that can *only navigate in geofenced premapped areas are you kidding me?* -\tIve seen quite a lot of videos of FSD by a variety of pretty impartial small youtubers and, although it definitely isnt perfect, I found it pretty impressive how it handled tricky situations. Ive seen quite a few drives with zero disengagements by now.   Of course again since I do not personally own FSD I feel like I might have a wrong impression of its current state, so please fill me in on it. Also again since Im in the minority I could be Just blind to some obvious problems Im not seeing, please explain where Im wrong, dont Just downvote lol This is hilarious. This shit ain't worth anything near that. Our Y has FSD and the new 3 doesn't.  There wasn't anything besides auto lane change that I would want and at the most I'd offer $500 for it.  Otherwise,  it's probably my biggest regret in owning a Tesla.  I wonder if some of the price increase is to prepare for the inevitable HW4 retrofit that will be needed. It's not even worth 1k Can I buy a used Tesla at a random dealership and if the previous owner has FSD I get it? Why are they increasing the price for something that is still basically a beta test product? I dont see how this is justified.    Love my model 3 with the standard autopilot, thank you. Keep calling it full self driving Eloneventually it might actually be that. Fix phantom braking on autopilot first. it's amazing how they can charge 12k for a product that doesn't exist and people still buy it.... Stupid This is not the reaction I expected from this sub.  Honestly I expected you all to just lap it up.  Im so proud of everyone who is finally seeing through his bullshit. Scam ""It seems like no one is buying our non-existent product. IDEA! Let\'s raise the price!"" Maybe they realized everyone with FSD is going to need another $2K worth of camera and computer upgrades. I'm happy at the state of this thread. No fanboyism in sight.   Every bit of automation and UX on this car has gotten progressively worse since somewhere around the V10 release.  Great car to drive manually but I wouldn't even recommend anyone to pay for EAP these days. I'd love to sell back my EAP for $5k.  NOA isn't for me, at all.  Drives like a drunk sailor. Don't care &amp; don't need it....perfectly happy with my original autopilot How does he keep raising the price on something that doesnt work? Doesnt work worth well enough for $2K (not a typo) in my opinion. Thats suspicious  At this point FSD is just becoming more and more of a party trick appealing to those with disposable income Lmao, any higher and itll be worth replacing the entire battery instead to keep FSD 10-20+ years down the road.  After a certain point, people would rather replace their batteries and motors to keep their FSD rather than buy a new car. So whats the new subscription price? He keeps increasing the prices, just to make it cost prohibitive to the average Joe.   FSD is a marketing gimmick at best.  Youre basically paying $12k to be a beta tester and help train Elons neural net. I have FSD beta (monthly subscription), and its overhyped and not worth it. Phantom breaking is a real problem and its not safe in some situations. His decision to remove radar for a pure vision based system is questionable. He said he wants the car to drive like a humans with eyes, when that obviously should never be the goal (because humans suck at driving). SO MANY NERDS. Elon, I accept your offer to pay me $12,000, annually, to be your Full Stunt Driver. Love Tesla but FSD is a sweet scam by Elon. If theyre charging $12K to unlock FSD, they should sells cars without all the FSD componentry to customers who cant afford or dont want it. Im on my second Model 3, the first one I bought FSD at $6k and after having it for 2 years and finally being on the beta program, I did not purchase it on my new one. Simply not worth it. All I ever really use is lane keep, and that comes standard. FSD beta was more of a fun little gimmick for a couple of weeks, but I felt extremely uncomfortable using it on any sort of standard basis. I could get FSD for $99 a month and wont get it. Would I pay $12k? Not worth it. When does Tesla have to start refunding these FSD buys? Ive got quite a bit invested and love my model 3 but at some point you wonder.   Its been long enough that people who bought FSD are now selling their cars and never got what was promised.   This wont go well if it takes another few years or a decade to get to FSD. Its false advertising. I bought my car in 2019 and to upgrade to FSD the promise was buy it now for $7k and FSD will come complete in 2021. ap should stop at lights and signs. maybe even auto lane change.      12k should only be worth it if the car had general ai and could be my romantic companion. Not worth it yet, it just doesnt live up to the price tag. In the future? Hopefully yeah, but my dad was just complaining about buying FSD on his Model 3 three years ago, and he still cant use it. Things you dont preorder: 1) games, 2) FSD Some people must hate to drive and FSD is/will be for them. Teslas are so fun to drive so there's no way I would pay thousands of dollars to not drive my car. Also, I feel like FSD is going to be even more stressful than having control of the car until at least most of the cars out there have FSD or something similar.   Don't get me wrong, I would love it if everyone on the road bought used FSD. Just not me! I love to drive. thats od. I'm never getting it. I'm so glad I bought Enhanced Autopilot when I did and skipped out on FSD.  Can we agree that it's a total rip-off? Fuckin A. If youre that hellbent on not driving, $12,000 buys a lot of Uber rides. And you dont have to pay for parking! they should be paying us to test drive it and collecting priceless data; amazing how people are putting down cash for this, and then again with new car Newest version, is very advanced. Got rid of radar. Got rid of vision. Now operates entirely by smell. Version 12.2, its entirely resistant to all emissions, including whoopee cushions. The next version, avoids fire hydrants. Why is he doing this? Is one of the most profitable companies in the world spread too thin? Cmon Elon, this shit is ridiculous. If Tesla cant afford to offer something that isnt even ready for market yet for a reasonable price, maybe theyve been running before they can walk. Rome wasnt built in a day.  Edit: a word Watch EAP gradually move up to the price point of FSD in its place... Gah. It was a hard pass at 10k. as fucking if Just over $15k in Canada.    I bought this for my Model 3 (2018) which now has over 100k km on it.  At this rate, the car will be sold by the time FSD is even trustworthy much less 'complete'.  I didn't even consider it when ordering my X.  The biggest issue for me isn't the price, but the non-transferrable software license. I find a certain irony in the fact that I desire FSD much less after having owned a Tesla.   It's just much easier to rely on myself to pilot the car than to have to worry about the car phantom braking, or freaking out about lane merges that it doesn't understand (yet have been present on my commute for the past 5 years without improvement). Just say no FSD is an NFT. You pay for it but then you don't realize what you paid for while you wait for your safety score Elon - you suck at UX. Fix my car - dont make it more difficult to use with updates. FSD? No fucking way. I thought for sure a discount or refund was coming. Not a price increase. Wow. Sorry if it has been asked. Are we grandfathered into the 10k price if already ordered ? I really don't get this. Shouldn't they try to have full self driving on as many cars are possible, to better train the neural net? Who is gonna spend 12k for something that may never actually work? People do not realize that they actually do not want FSD. They want the IDEA of FSD since its such a monumental sci-fi like achievement we all joked about as kids.  But really, *really* think about it for a second. If it was released tomorrow and it worked would you deep down inside trust it? Would you trust it with your significant other/kids in the car? It litterally has to work 100% of the time, there can not be a fraction of error possibility.   The confidence we feel on the road is attributed to our control of our car. Have you ever noticed when sitting ad a passenger with a fully competent driver we still feel slightly uneasy? We question their decisions, brake distances, lane changes etc? This is minor in comparison to what FSD anxiety will bring.   Autonomous vehicles typically have a set pathway they follow with very little new variables that pose a threat. Guiding a car down a road it faces infinite number of dangerous situations every minute.  I had FSD. It had the ability to auto lane change for me on the highway when it decided it wanted to. Even this simple level of AI driving was too much for me because its choices were always different to mine. Even at $10k, it's well above what I'm willing to pay for it, *even if it were fully functional.*  At this point, I don't think I'll have FSD until it becomes a standard feature in every car.  And let's face it, if the safety benefits are as strong as they are claiming they will be, regulations will be such that once it is available and reliable, it will become mandated.  It will take a few years, but that's what will happen. Lmao this is embarrassing at this point Frame Shift Drive  I start to think this is retarded, but then I realize that there are people buying $50 whistles so this isnt so bad. When YouTubers go viral because they found an edge case where they had to intervene on FSD, then it's worth even $250000.  In it's current state, it's an overpriced L2 driving assistant Tesla is a bunch if thieves. Youre better off now purchasing and just putting it in stock. You wont get your FSD for another half decade anyways lol I think $12k is a steal, IF it would really be FSD!    And by FSD I mean what a Volvo executive said about FSD: Only if I don't have to observe the car and look on the road, and the most important part, Volvo will pay for any liabilities in case of a crash, because the company has so much confidence in the software that they know it will almost never happen, than we can speak of a real full self-driving car! I think you'd be better off buying 12 Tesla shares, then cash them in when it's in release 2.0, laws and regulations have been nailed and you'd be ahead. I don't have a problem with the price itself, but i strongly dislike the fact they're raising the price again without a new feature added.  The $2k increase (double the usual) to $10k was supposed to be for City Streets, and was kinda shit considering it happened nearly a full year before the average person could get their hands on it at all.  So another $2k increase before its fully out, and without a new feature is really shitty. And bear in mind that's coming from someone who loves and values FSD. 2021 Model 3  Reverse camera is lagging.  When is fix coming? why are people up voting this price increase? I almost used my 5k rebate to buy FSD when the price was 8k. Then they raised it to 10k right before I got my check, and I said Im out. After reading some of these comments Im glad I used that money to pay off my loan faster. I can only think that they are trying to push subscriptions over single payments.  Probably will eliminate that option completely down the road. Sure, why not $120k. Lol. Might as well just raise it to $50k as $12k is now completely unreasonable. Let us transfer our current FSD that we bought (AND HAVE NEVER HAD) then sure The key here is that Tesla wants to be a subscription company, so FSD will be subscription only as soon as it actually works. The price rise here is only to stop people buying it today, and have them subscribe tomorrow.  Also, buying FSD today will have you buy-in to planned obsolescence. In 10 years your 2019 Model 3 will still be running v11 with phantom braking, while everyone else in their subscription CyberTrucks will be running v3000 software compatible with boring tunnels. Thanks Elon, wont be buying a Tesla - Ever. I thought fsd was going subscription and that was the best strategy?  Why are the still messing around not only raising the price but having a paid option? Ah.. the old tell em before it happens to inflate sales which inflated share price before I arm them trick.. another market manipulation play from Musk. Bravo. Must be ADD to love FSD as is I guess. My ""Snowbird"" Y took an unexpected turn to an exit recently as I was daydream driving.  First thought was WTH, then realized oh yeah, I was supposed to take that exit. FSD is so bad, they don't even use it in the Las Vegas scam tunnel, but have to rely on human drivers. It's a completely controlled environment. Worth nothing in the UK as you can only legally use it as cruise control on motorways. anyone know the real reason why they r not making thr fSD follow the account ? ask elon musk!!! The current price is pretty steep so its mind boggling to me theyve chosen to increase it even more. What price is it going to be when FSD actually work? 20k? 25k? 30k? If the price is high enough, then those who have it might defend it to justify their purchase.   This is how I view the Apple Tax. You pay more expecting to get the value for the money, then retroactively justify the purchase in denial when you encounter deficiencies. Then more money is spent to improve the experience since all the products are designed with very specific restrictions to encourage purchasing more peripherals and add more technical debt on the investment in the ""ecosystem"".  Deliver a working complete product. Reduce the scope if nessesary. Or at the very least give users some portability. Each year is another batch of expiring leases and vehicle warranties with undelivered promises.  It\'s great software, but there is a big disconnect between the marketing, the user expectation, and the price vs performance. I wonder if they are preparing for a required hardware upgrade... like more cameras...  Thus if you don't have it, the higher price will cover the expense of the required retrofit.  If only they had the foresight to design a modular easy-to-upgrade and easy-to-service solution. Then installing new/better/more cameras would be cheap and easy. Did the subscription, did the FSD Beta, I would be pissed if I paid anything more than the $199/month for two months that I had it. As a new Tesla owner, this is not worth it.  I had the subscription for the last month and the only thing I liked was auto lane change and that should be part of the package that comes with the car.  It does when you purchase a BMW with the advanced assistance package.  Other than that is definitely was not self driving.  Really bad when using FSD on a freeway exit.  Tesla is a long ways from FSD, unless something drastic changes soon, especially in a winter climate. You have to be fucking crazy to pay this much. You won't even have your car by the time this works. So many morons with so much money. Too easy. Bargain. It pays for itself in 5 months. Everyone with FSD is earning $30,000 a year from their robotaxi, right? This man is out of his mind we basically pay the cost for the development of FSD, which has been pretty much zero outside the US. Love my model Y, but as soon as rivian, Chevy, ram and others get all the bugs worked out Im switching Tesla just doesnt care about its customers and charges us for everything Lol the price of a nonexisting product rises, which is only a promise which will IMO not be fulfilled for most cars on the road today. Great. Instead of wasting time on this nonsense they might be better announcing a battery rental scheme where you woul pay yearly for your battery and they would be responsible for recycling it. That way you would not fall off a cliff when your battery is damaged or reaches its end of life. Yer I paid for it in the UK on an S when it was 6800. Then sold the car and lost it. Yup boohoo for me.  However no chance in paying for it again. Currently its not worth 500 per year IMO.  (Its crippled to hell and back in the UK.) I will pay $12K for a fully working product. As it stands, I think Tesla should be paying FSD owners for continuing to test their Beta version. My MS is coming out of warranty shortly. I'm sooo glad I didn't waste whatever it was for FSD - around 10k GBP I think. When I received my car for some reason they enabled all the toys, only AP worked reliably (ish). Autopark would just fuck itself straight in to a curb.  12k for a dangerous gimmick, no thanks.   Elon has boxed himself in to a corner, these features should have been a USP of the car not a downloadable option. The hardware still needs to be paid for which raises the cost of materials. Their dumb firesales don't help the situation either.  They've also left the older MCU 1 &amp; 2 units dead in the water - so much for continually improving cars. I decided to keep my old ICE car just in case, she's about 6 years old now - seriously don't know what the plan will be for the Tesla, I don't want to be holding the warranty bag when that expires.   Rivian possibly, but man just getting a decent BMW M6 or something sounds mighty tempting just so I don't have to deal with this crap Not worth it at 500 imo. Not in the uk anyway Also, its still not actually full self-driving FSD is not worth half of that in its current state, and I don't see huge improvements coming anytime soon.  Not worth. Didn't your average consumer break his tesla with just the self parking feature?   I feel like FSD isn't ready for sure yet 2016 Tesla Model S - bought Full Autopilot (aka FSD) back then.   Have since sold the car without a CPU upgrade and no real value from it.  2017 Tesla Model S - bought full autopilot and paid for the MCU upgrade myself (UI was super laggy).    No real value from it.  I know some will say  but you got some autopilot stuff.   True.   But thats not what I paid for.   I paid for a robo-taxi that was promised to me by Musk during the MobileEye divorce.   End of 2017 at the LATEST was the quote.   Im holding off on renewing the Model S again until this gets solved.  I have 60,000 miles on it and I will just drive it into the ground before buying another Tesla - unless I get autopilot or unless they make the license transferable. This is crap decision elon. Im not happy with the fsd software threee years on after purchase. Its not worth $12k and you know it bud. I say this as an investor b I dont understand why Tesla needs to milk their customers in this way, for a feature that is still in beta and its even possible will be realised after the owner will change the car. I wont be purchasing it again. Regular AP is great, FSD drives like a drunk and you have nanny AI ready to take it away if it thinks youre not paying attention. Does it restore the seat heater and defrost buttons back to the bottom of the screen? I got in at $6K with my 2019 3LRAWD. The only killer feature for me is Navigate on Autopilot for the Interstate portions of roadtrips. Right now, FSD (not the beta) does not offer significant advantages over AP, and there's no discernable timeline for advancing the FSD beta to a point where it offers meaningful autonomy safely. My view is that Tesla ought to changeover to offering FSD as a post-purchase upgrade with no pricing penalty. Right now, there's really nothing to sell and this has been ongoing for almost six years. Tesla owners like me that pre-bought FSD and are watching our cars age towards retirement ought to be offered discounts on FSD for our next Tesla purchase. Lol What's the point of paying $12k if my non FSD tesla is capable of using the monthly subscription for $199? If this was a lifetime sub then maaaaaybe it will be worth considering. Because it stays with the car - no way.   Once finalized it will be copied by every manufacturer and become a commodity standard with every vehicle.   People are literally paying to be alpha testers. It should be free for all Teslas as a thank you for early access beta testing. Once it's actually FSD they can make all new owners pay for it. Does the price stay at the current $10,000 for those who reserved a vehicle waiting for VIN? If so, I am sticking with the add-on (I was debating whether removing it). I am planning to keep this car a long time and thought adding on later, but this may have just made up my mind. Fraud as it can get. US regulators are sleeping on Tesla selling FSD since 2016 which does not exists and may never come. Driving been responsible at level 2 is not not what was promised as level 5 fsd. Tesla cults may get jolt of shock when they find its just a another EV with low quality compare to others So not worth the money. I cancelled my FSD Beta subscription a couple weeks ago. It is a long long ways from production ready in my opinion. Lol, not even tempted to buy it. Elon seems to be whipping that department more and more. Rewrite after rewrite and it hasn't really managed to move the mark forward much. At this point, Hotz will probably manage to catch up with them. They are getting pretty close with Comma 3.  At this point I think FSD is less about the tech and more about how much extra margin Musk can get. The Autopilot team hasn't grown much. With a 5% take rate that's an extra half billion. More than enough to cover the team and make some profit. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.  Still doesn't work. So let's raise the price. 12K for vaporware that occasionally kills people, with no resale value. Don't think I'll be adding that to cart. I'm still dithering about whether to buy my first Tesla.  My current vehicle is at 106k miles and nearly 8 years old, so not frequently.  I like tech, so would be a normal target.  But this is a LOT of money. Still waiting on the US Congress to decide on tax rebate  Every day i feel more and more pushed in the direction of a ~$12,000 Chinese EV.  Which aren't for sale in the US yet. But time seems to be like a river carrying me to this result. Does the basic model even do lane keeping or do you have to pay $10K to get that? Are they asking to people to pay for something that's not ready?? I took delivery of my Model 3 Dual Motor in October 2018, and this was my experience as well. EAP was $5k. The configurator had no option for FSD at all. ok this might be a stupid question ... why is the price steady rising for something thats in beta and not in production? Given how limited autopilot is I don't have a lot of faith in full self-driving The goal is fewer litigants in the future class action lawsuit. FSD problems aside, has this technically increased the value of any Tesla that already had FSD? Imagine paying actual money for """"""FSD""""""  That would be so embarrassing Hard pass. Most people that buy/bought FSD will be on their next Tesla before FSD becomes a reality. All you really need is AP. Why is the price rising? R&amp;D costs? Im just gonna come out and say it:  FSD is maybe, at best, worth about $1500 max right now.   The only thing that hiking the price to 12k will do is incentivize the subscription servicemaybe.  I also think that the subscription service is overpriced as well.  50-75 a month? Perhaps. 200? Nope. I wish they would uncouple the ""dumb"" summon (just forward and backward) from FSD. It is really handy for tight parking situations and see no reason it should require FSD. Software developer salaries are high. Also, some people are more inclined to buy something if they know the price will likely rise in the future. In the ""you get what you pay for"" mindset, more $$$$ equals better. I once tried to sell an item (given to me that I no longer needed) for a low price. No takers. I tripled the price and got more interest and a buyer. I bouhht fsd with my m3, 3 years ago, and I *still* don't have fsd. Someone should file a class action. Beyond the discussion of whether or not it's worth this price, I wonder what this means feature-wise? Is this just an arbitrary $2k bump or could it hint at new features soon being rolled out to the public release?  The full city streets navigation on the beta still seems a little too rocky to move it up to the public just yet, but maybe a subset of that (like being able to make turns at stop signs or something) could be a nice addition. What a fucking scam. Any hope of ever getting autopilot + Gotta do something to get people to buy (""buy before the lettuce goes up further!!"") Because they damn sure aren\'t buying for the actual feature set. I wouldn't buy it until i can even turn it on. I am in australia. Is the price locked in at $10k for a current order? I was on the fence, but I am thinking to keep it now. Still waiting for VIN. Anyone that would buy FSD today at almost any price is ignorant of its capabilities and probability that it will ever be level 5 on the vehicle they own or buy today.  Form what I have seen as a beta tester (yes, I have 9.8), it is already taxing the hardware and I seriously doubt that the hardware in current vehicles is capable.  Second, the software is very buggy and unpredictable.  I suspect the only buyers will be those that buy the advertising on the web site and the hype or those that are too ignorant to know they are not getting a working product.  A better use of that $12K is to buy Tesla on the dip.  You could buy almost 12 shares and in 3 years if Tesla stock reaches $1,500 you will have earned enough to pay for  or essentially buy it for $6K assuming it is actually a product by then.  You won't have missed anything except some harrowing experiences. I can only imagine how much money itll be when I can finally use it. FSD on public streets is tricky as it is - they need to fix the damn summon and auto park before expecting someone to pay 12k! I can still buy for 8k, you think I should ? Lol who the hell buys this? Literally barely works in Europe, aint no one paying $12k here Not worth it. If I would know I will just do subscription, I bought it when it was like $6k (2k for AP) so total of $8k.   If the FSD can transfer then I think it would be a better deal Lol, mad lad by the time it\'s ""fully functional"" and ready for prime time and really hands off... my FSD computer be obsolete and i wouldn\'t be able to take advantage of it anyway. even with great progress that was made already one still has to BEHAVE to be allowed to use FSD. so what you get is enhanced Autopilot, not worse the money. I feel this is way overpriced in my opinion. Maybe if FSD Beta was in a much wider release then sure. I have a model S on order with expected delivery on April.   I tried to add FSD to the vehicle before the price goes up next week. However, adding it increases my price to the current price of 95k and pushes delivery to November 2022.  I called tesla and they confirmed that I cannot add it without changing  the current configuration. $12k for a product that doesn't exist and probably can't exist.  If they figure out FSD in perfect weather, it's still not going to work in the winter with snow obscuring the road markings. If I pay Tesla $12k, will their FSD hardware figure out when to turn wipers on/off? Nothing yet Lol... I made someone jump their purchase by 3 months quoting this tweet!! Fsd is back to $10,000 randomly seams no one else is reporting it How can I get my FSD money refunded ? This has been a total scam.",10706,"but not in Europe right? Would be weird since there are no improvements in Europe Well, they're not helping to ease the inflation haha People were saying the same thing from 2k to 5k to 10k. People are purchasing FSD so raising the price is obviously working. Personally I think FSD is a huge liability for investors but the also why Tesla is considered innovate and groundbreaking. I wonder if the subscription price will change, and if it does, how ""grandfathering"" plays into this price increase with said subscription. If I subscribe today for $199 and it goes up to $299, do I only get one month @ $199 and then I have to pay $299 thereafter, or do I get grandfathered in at the $199 rate? Ive pretty much been priced out of ever owning Tesla What about my CT order FSD cost? BULLISH Wonder if the Cybertruck orders will stay at $10k.. I would only consider it if I could transfer the software key to another vehicle if and when I upgrade 12k will buy about 11 shares of TSLA.  Those shares, unlike a certain taxi that may be robotic, actually exist and have a much more concrete chance of appreciating in value over the next few years. Its definitely not worth it for todays features, even with the beta. Really they should almost be paying us to test the beta but \u200d  The tricky part is that it could be, and likely will be, worth it down the line. But where is that line? Its been right around the corner for years and for those who bought it early one, its been a complete ripoff. Then again, the FSD beta IS getting pretty good and moving into production this year is looking more likely.   Ive got the beta and the price($7k) was worth it to me. For most people, I dont think that would be the case I'd settle for the base autopilot that comes standard (free) with all Tesla's***  *** Except for those that bought model 3's prior to April 2019.  They still want $3,000 from us unlucky few that missed the cut. So the question is: he claims the price will increase as they get closer to production level code. If the price is going up on January 17, does that means FSD beta will reach 11.0 before then to stipulate the price increase? Not worth it at 10k and definitely not worth it at 12k. Hard pass for me. This is a terrible move on their part to constantly increase prices on something many people dont even have yet even after having paid for it. I cant wait for other companies to be more competitive with teslas tech to drive the ridiculous price down. It will come eventually, just not soon enough. Read so many comments. Sorry to hear so many disappointed people with FSD package. Yeah it has a long way to go but the AP features that are with it and not standard are so useful. I probably have over 80% of my mileage in autopilot. I am so much more relaxed with it driving. The price of hospital care if you survive is more...I personally like driving, call me crazy AP is plenty... FSD is not good Cool. How much will it cost when it actually works? Take youre $12k and buy Tesla Stonks, then cash them in when FSD is actually FSD Surprised to see so much push back on this forum. I'm proud of you guys  Not worth buying. Funny, I bought my fun to drive 2017 Model S 75D to actually have fun driving it. Actual FSD is a long way off if you ask me. I was dumb enough to pay for it twice. Used market apparently doesnt value FSD as a package for very much either, so whats the point here? Nope!! Hope subscription pricing doesnt go up while they are at it. Seeing this kind of response in a r/Teslamotors thread makes feel better about waiting to upgrade my 3 to a Y but not wanting to lose my FSD tied to my 3 (bought in 2019 for 6k).  So I wait. Until I drive to work more than one day a week I dont need it. At this point my wife drives the 3 more than I do. I believe from my experience with 2 teslas (1 brand new M3P) is that the greatest things about the car are performance, range, and total superiority to a gas powered car.  The self driving benefits are great but are only nice to haves. FSD is nowhere near a $12k nice to have feature. At the current price of FSD, assuming they can actually pull it off it's still better to invest that money into TSLA Have it on my 2018 m3 would buy it again for 5k. No more. Like it a lot but not worth more than that. FSD Sub is still the better value. I'm not a fan of Tesla forcing FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) by raising the price. Robo taxis here we come. why is it getting a price increase, is it significantly better? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy) This comment section reeks It's bullshit that features like Auto park were included on my 2013 Hyundai, but my model 3 performance has it pay walled behind a bunch of features that aren't available in my country.  I need a second EV and the FSD pricing structure has me looking at other brands. Break out the features in to affordable add ons that stick with my account. Don't penalise your customers for buying a car after arbitrary price rises. Elon is pricing FSD out of reach for people. If i purchase it - it would have to be FSD beta not the crap in subscription model. Its worthless ITT: buncha mad MFS GOUGING is just gonna get worse  To accelerate the world towards (immense profits)  SMH I dont need fsd This entire thread:  Guy on reddit &gt; richest man on earth Just wait for real competition to enter the EV market (it's coming!), and Tesla will eventually include FSD at no add'l cost (or as a reasonably priced feature/upgrade). And thats why I bought it for $10k folks. Because I know this shit is just gonna get more expensive every year. If youre on that 200/mo subscription you are an idiot Oh this is just the beginning. Once FSD is actually going to drive by itself(no bug), it will be at least $20k. For those who say its too expensive. No one is asking you to buy it. Technology increase costs money. Dont get me wrong $12k is a lot An unpopular opinion here, but Elon on lexs podcast mentioned L4 will be achieved this year. 12K for this L4 feature would be totally worth it. Now the question is, is L4 coming soon? Obviously Elon knows more about FSD than you and me. He is probably driving alpha FSD v11 right now and its his view it is worth 12K. So I would give him the benefit of the doubt. Theyre going to sell the auto-lane-change and auto-park in a cheaper package; this makes room for that. Oh no, everyone panic People complain but the 10k was worth it to me before I got into FSD Beta. Now? So glad I got it when I did, use it daily and it cuts a significant amount of stress out of my life. Anyone who doesn't appreciate it can just live with AP for free so not sure why the complaints. Bought it at $2k fire sale.  Tried the beta and requested the fsb team multiple times to get rid of it so I can have my radars functioning again.  If I can get a refund for it, I would. The price has nothing to do about selling it. He is just looking what it costs at this point, how much development has been put towards it and what it will cost when Tesla rolls out their rob taxis. He said publicly that you actually wouldn't want to buy Teslas because they will be too expensive, like 300K per car. You will have to buy the service from Tesla and pay fees. Pay $10K now, or pay $20K later. Definitely better to include FSD in your purchase so that it's part of your car loan instead of a credit card payment. How much are other automakers charging for an equivalent product? The answer is there is no equivalent product, which is why Musk can keep raising the price. Im not defending the price hike, I have FSD from 2018 and I wouldnt recommend anyone spend 12k or even 10k, but this is simple market economics. The amount of people buying FSD will continue to dwindle but since Tesla doesnt need the money right now it doesnt matter, if he manages to make FSD work people will buy it for even more at that point. Unlike other with cars people dont have to make the decision when they buy the car. If it gets to the point where people can nap in the car, barring snow or severe weather, people will pay a ton for that. I dont think the current system can get there, even though Im blown away with the progress, but future iterations will. Nice! Worth. It was worth it when I paid $8k and itll still be worth it for $12k. I paid 6k for it and while I dont regret it because its been rewarding to be a part of something so cutting-edge. FSD beta is something I am great-full to have experienced.   With all that being said I wouldnt repurchase even for 6k if I had the chance. Lol, what a dick.   &amp;#x200B;  Happy I locked mine in I guess but seriously, wtf. I think everyone's getting on Musk too hard.     I'll be getting the cybertruck with the FSD. I'll do it because I know it's not a perfect system, but it's directly contributing to making the future of driving. Unlike many Tesla fans, I'm realistic about what FSD can and cannot do (and have been since the beginning). But I know that contributing to it contributes to getting someone to bring us autonomous driving that much faster. Think about it, how big of a fire did Tesla light under the a\\*\\* of the big, monolithic car companies that stopped caring about their consumers, the environment and only their bottom line? How many companies started their own autonomous unit just because Tesla decided to be bold enough to jump into the fire?     Even if you don't get what you imagined you would have, you've made a difference. Your contribution has changed the world for the better. Not only has it created the waves we need to finally get humans from behind wheel (saving countless lives) but you've moved our species forward by that much.     If you're frustrated with your purchase, at least find some solace in that. I'll be willingly throwing myself into the fire to support the first car company with the gall to challenge the status quo way ahead of everyone else.     We have literally seen the Ford of the modern era created in real time and it's beautiful, even with its ugly aspects (FSD, panel gaps, customer service). And yet, Tesla is worth $1 TRILLION There was a time where a tesla would have been my no brained choice for an electric vehicle. It is pretty close to being my last at this point. Dude could slowly liquidate his 200-300 billion dollars (probably not in his lifetime) yet won't put 1 billion of it towards FSD, which would save lives and even make him money.   &amp;#x200B;  Dude is allergic to taking risks even though...he can't really take any 'risks' anymore. What if I told you guys they dont want to sell you FSD for a fixed price that includes upgrading the hardware etc? They want you to pay for the subscription, and pay to upgrade the hardware yourself.  Theyll make more money that way.",93

Nice fluid dynamics effect on that vent For anyone curious what the vent is for, it's believed to be a test of the gas supply system used to help ignite the outer ring of 20 engines on SH. Those engines only ignite on the ground, so it saves a lot of weight on the booster to have their gas supply come from the ground rather than COPVs.

This thing is gonna be pretty tolerant. Awesome Why does it need a catcharm? Why is landing on its own not feasible? It will be interesting to watch it attempt to ""catch a falling StarShip"", perhaps in mid-2022. Watch out for the Bronteroc once you land on Mars! That structure is immensely tall.   The ""catch"" will all but be done via the controlled landing that Starship is capable of doing, and getting the landing on point without much drift.    Can that tower withstand a horizontal blow?    Any chance they have sensors and data analysis instruments atop that tower for reading wind speeds, rain and moisture content etc ? Man that catch is going to be a sight to see.

As great as this is, we still have idiots in office here we have one of the highest tax rates in the country, soon probably a tax on breathing. State: go solar, its cheaper!  Wait, were losing revenue because everyone is going solar?  Tax solar!!  \u200d Lets save the planet and go green, Im all for it!  Lets tax the people with solar now because were to stupid and cant find how to get additional tax revenue because were already taxing everything.  Seriously, whos bright idea was it to tax solar? Like why the f would I go solar if the idiots are just going to tax it anyway?   I truly dont understand how you can do this.   While Id love to visit California, doing something like this makes me want to never go and give them my business. Sorry for the people whos trying to do the right thing and save our planet. To add some perspective, this fee looks copied directly from the State of Alabamas very successful playbook for killing solar.  So is California now following in the footsteps of Alabama? At that point wouldn't it be cheaper to get some power walls and not allow selling back to the grid and just use the grid as a backup? Though I think taxing users to supply power to the grid is a good idea, $8/month/kW is a little absurd.  Maybe if that was a per year fee, I would see it as a little more realistic. This whole electrification isn't thought out on the government level. Here in CA Edison tells me to turned down the AC during the hottest days and on the other hand they are becoming our source of 'fuel' for EVs. It's just a matter of time (very soon) when we are going to pay more for charging than for paying $5/gal. Their excuse will be the need to update the already outdated grid which was partially built and is maintained with tax payers' money. Look what they do with the solar energy now? They get it for free from homeowners with solar and resell it as a 'green' at higher prices than 'non green' electricity \u200d. We need to push the f**rs to not charge for the solar power the homeowners generate, that energy should be going back to 'grid' and and used a free energy. This way we all would contribute to lower rates by investing in the solar systems and contribute to electrification. No one should be paying $500 per month for electcity during hot summer days with the amount of sun we get here. This is just insane. Thanks for the FYI. This is outrageous and will add my name to it as well.  This should be stickied for all who own solar to see. What starts in California goes all over the USA.   Monthly fees/taxes could add up to more than the system cost themselves. Hope most of us don't go back to use Gas cars instead but this is a good motivator.   [ From what I read, it's just a proposal that the governor already said he thinks needs to be reevaluated.  Similar situation here is being proposed by my utility in Texas (tho not a fee, just halving the buy back rate). I have a feeling the savings from solar is about to be attacked from every angle. I've read the proposal and I still don't understand. How does killing roof top solar help lower income families exactly? If grid maintenance has a cost charge that to everyone. Roof top solar is generating power where the power is being used so it requires much less grid infrastructure anyways.   This makes zero sense. Absolutely insane but its also CA so not totally shocking theyd be this dumb Sure, why not?  I already pay $200 more a year for driving an EV.  Next year they're going to charge me more tax for not smoking...  The CA gov is corrupt to its core. Thank you for the heads up.  PUC did the same thing to us when I lived in Colorado.  Slowed the entire solar movement to a crawl.  Energy companies are doing everything they can to hang on to their monopolies. This is nuts! I believe this goes hand in hand with new build homessolar is required for anything newly built down in LA and Ventura County. A condo, house or even an ADU requires solar panels to be added. What a setup! dumbest shit i've seen From what I read, tho admittedly limited, the one party state of California is being fucked by the single party in power. This is another crazy example So if you generate 1 MWh per month you will pay $80 a month.  I wonder if you pay more in the summer when the days are longer or is this just for energy returned to the grid?  Throw in some fees for administrating the plan and this is more expensive than my electric bill was. Its crazy. They are also trying to charge you more for the electricity you use, and pay you a lot less for the electricity you sell back.   Those under NEM 1 and NEM 2 contracts can keep their same agreement (15-20 years), then they will be forced to follow this new NEM 3.   This Essentially makes the resale of a house with Solar, worse. The EU has just changed its tune on nuclear, poor Germany has just shut down their last reactor. i can understand if they want us to pay for upkeep maintenance on the grid but the problem with this is that they dont even allow us the option to ""get off the grid"", they are trying to trap us into their monopoly and raising fees. While the rates may be excessive, its not unreasonable to pay for a connection to your house.   The same problem that happens with EVs and road tax is going to happen with electricity. The infrastructure needs to be maintained, so it becomes a question of how to allocate those costs to the users. If you dont want to be connected, then dont complain when solar doesnt work and your batteries go dead.  Lots of complaining, but legitimate question, how should the costs of maintenance for the distribution networks be paid? Wait so we get electricity for free but we actually have to pay for it? With my provider ""access costs"" are billed separately from usage for everyone. These costs represent the fixed infrastructure: lines, poles, transformers, switches ETC.   Many providers work this into the usage charge, and in those cases solar users need to be charged a fee as they benefit from that infrastructure, often without paying anything.   Charging a fee based on the KW capacity is not the correct way to rectify this though. Lmao  land of the free ..   I mean its illegal to be off grid with your solar panels and power wall.   Well done Freedomland. Most people think solar is easy to tie to the grid.  It's not. The more solar we add, the harder the fossil fuel generators have to work to keep the frequency and power regulated. Ramp up and ramp down times have to be faster. Dirty on demand power in case you have a cloudy, hot day. Like, waaaaay more on demand power. It was easy with coal plants. Solar and wind... not so much.  Solar is gonna be tricky. California has done a great job of getting more solar on the grid... now they're going to have to figure out how to match power to demand. The idea is to pay for maintenance of the lines and stuff, which will become grossly underfunded as more people go solar (and we still need the grid, because it will be decades, if ever, before homes and businesses have sufficient local energy storage to be self-sufficient 24/7/375).   I get that. It makes logical sense, even.  But the proposed tax rate is ABSURD. $8 per kW? The average system is 6kW and that's growing...most new installs are likely averaging more like 8kW. You're going to stick the people who use the least power and do the most to combat climate change with an extra $48-64 bill PER MONTH? (on top of whatever grid power they use and associated fees with that)  That's way beyond what's needed to maintain the grid, and it will practically kill residential solar. It will take an extra decade or more for solar installations to pay for themselves. It throws the economic incentive so far out of whack. Where's the warning label?  WARNING: Electricity generated by solar panels is known to the State of California to cause cancer Wait. WTF? So if you have just two powerwalls that's 27 * 8 or $216 tax for -- nothing? Good! I wish they'd do that here in Florida!! They should have started in 2015 when they had the same problem with SRP in phoenix instead of settling out of court for SRP to subsidize power walls.  #:~:text=SolarCity%2FTesla%20took%20the%20case%20to%20the%20Supreme%20Court,megawatt%2F100%20MW-hour%20battery%20energy%20storage%20system%20from%20Tesla. We need to go green, but we also need to have a functioning power grid. Solar users benefit from net metering and being connected 24/7 to the grid, and the more solar is installed, the more the grid will struggle.   Solar users need to pay their fair share, or else the whole grid will collapse. This is the same problem as with roads - EV users act as freeloaders when roads are paid for by gas taxes.  The solution, however, is not charging solar users based on the size of the system. The solution is one flat fee for everyone connected to the grid  one fee that truly pays for ensuring 100% uptime for the grid  and then one separate fee for KWh used. This would, most likely, result in solar users having their monthly bill go up, but thats an unfortunate reality.   If we want to have an extra subsidy on top of that to incentivize solar use, then thats fine, but it cant be so high that it threatens the grid as a whole  which is what would happen if current trends continue. $8/installed kWh is probably too high, but in case there are 3-4 cloudy days where the power walls have depleted and no-one else in the immediate area can generate solar either,. Even if your neighborhood only need to draw power from the grid 2-3 times a year, that power needs to be available, so there need to be other types of power generation capacity (gas generators, or solar/wind from out of state coming in via long distance power lines) available and that costs money to maintain.  For non-solar users, that availability and maintaining it is part of the power price.  I can see that charging a price for having the power on tap when you are not normally consuming much is worth something - sort of an insurance.  However, I think it would be better to have different types of plans - either a higher monthly fee (say the $8/kW/month) with low per kWh price, or a low monthly fee and very high per kWh price. FWIW there are [rallies in San Francisco and Los Angeles on Thursday]( asking Gov. Newsom to block the tax on rooftop solar. The thing about not playing nice with a tech that is disrupting your industry; is you just end up with the disrupting tech speeding up the disruption. I can see people disconnecting from the grid along with Tesla and other solar companies help speed it up.   Maybe we'll see Tesla work on more power wall options, maybe a Tesla grid connecting you to your neighbor power walls and solar systems. Local Tesla Megapacks in your block. Done, sent my message in. This is ridiculous! Next, tax for growing your own food. Charging people for using the sun. These fucking fucks So uh... can we get this help in Kansas too? Tell everyone to go green and then massacre them in more tax. Awesome :( its not like solar is cheap to get setup and installed California government is a clown show right now absolutely nothing makes any common sense. So there's a tax credit for installing solar but they want to tax it?  Come on guys make up your minds. Do you want people to use solar or not?

Id think maybe Texas would try something like that but not Cali Ill be so fucked  I just bought a house in august with an 8.4kwh system.   $70 extra a month. They're going to tax me for SUNLIGHT? California wants you to leave.   The tax revenue is irrelevant, when CCP buys up all the soon to pop, depressed real estate and pays off the corrupt government officials, buh-bye! I cant wrap my head around taxing the ability to have your stuff sunbath. Why though Legislators should be incentivizing renewable energy and sustainability, not disincentivizing. Bad for sales so of course lmao One of the biggest hurdles to going solar was/is the real estate investment required to set up said panels.  So you get homeowners to buy these expensive systems, and you use THEIR real estate, and equipment, and STEAL their unused electricity they generate and you STILL want to fucking tax them for it?  Go get fucked with a rusty spoon you stupid cunts. Call me confused.  Whatre they gonna do? Turn off the sun? Fuck these power companies They paying for Grid Access they can buy Solar unit that not connected to the grid like this Goes to show you that CA state government places higher priority on collecting revenues to keep employees paid than on saving the environment and the world. Get your priorities straight! Isnt this just an infrastructure problem whereby the current infrastructure isnt built to be fed excess power from the service end and this regulation is going to discourage that? If everyone (multimillionaire home owners iirc) just gets batteries and doesnt get pissy about the utility buying their excess power then we can all move on from this, no? This proposal is so bad it makes me think they are purposely putting out such a bad proposal and after all the uproar over it, they\'ll revise it to something ""better adjusted"" which will be exactly what they want and they\'ll call it a compromise and in actuality, it will still screw those with solar and greatly benefit the utilities. Lol assisting in a fight they want more money you dumbass Gavin Newsom is such a piece of shit. The state has a huge budget surplus, and yet we still get this new tax. Inflation is killing me already. I really don't need more taxes. Tesla assisting lol. Its like of course they are, its going to have a major negative impact on their business. Theyre not just assisting. They are taking lead and charging and asking other to help join them fight. Elons recent tweet is basically a plea for help. This is bullshit he tweets. But really he is asking can you guys help? I am so pissed off about this! Its highway robbery and a clear attempt to suppress new solar installs. These utilities could have been investing in renewables all along, and now expect consumers to foot the bill for their shortsightedness.  I'd go off grid before I paid them a penny. This is the first thing I have signed in a long time.  SIGN THE PETITION FOLKS! This is so infuriating. PGE is just charging insane amounts of money for energy and they dont need anymore. Does CA have a tax for everything? Tax the air too while you are at it Move to South Dakota. No income tax. They did away with charging for gun permits and new business filing fees. State has $ surplus. Land of the free. CA will tax everyone until they can get 100% of your paycheck. 12kW solar + 2PW here. I would disconnect from the grid so so fast. Will then throw the $100/mo fee into a MASSIVE diesel powered backup system installed directly into my front yard. Soon you will be taxed to breath Leave it to that cesspool on the west coast. So let me get this straight. People who get solar and are not using the infrastructure need to get taxed for other people using the infrastructure? Welcome to the mental olympics!! California should make PG&amp;E pay for all the maintenance and upgrades to the existing infrastructure. This is a complete joke and undermines the investment incentive of green energy. Also dont forget that power companies have an absolute monopoly which is why there are not locally maintained power grids. This is PG&amp;E looking to increase their quarterly profits. Nothing else. Our power co takes the energy we generate and charges other users for it. They give us back a minuscule amount back. I will gladly decouple! Huge tax revenue surplus. Wtf Only stupid California would tax something thats free like Solar",1580,"You should be getting a tax rebate for the foreseeable future until we get mass adoption Keep in mind that California [requires solar panels on all new houses constructed after Jan 1, 2020.]( So many in the future would just have a tax they can't do a whole lot about.  Plus, the value of solar panels increase property value on roughly a 1:1 basis, so they tax your property more for having solar. This is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. I think that works out to about 22c/kWh for power you *aren't* consuming.  If that isn't literally criminal, it should be.  In fact, the idea that CPUC  1) Made such a ridiculous proposal  2) Thinks that they can make such a ridiculous proposal without getting laughed out of the room  suggests that the commission needs to be investigated for racketeering. How About tesla help reduce the price of electricity in San Diego? Fuck California and fuck gavin newsom Its ridiculous. I've been getting quotes on solar the past few weeks, and every solar company has brought it up. Everybody wants the convenience of a reliable electric grid but doesn't want to pay for it. I think solar owners should have the choice - pay the 8 dollars or go completely off grid and rely on your own little solar system. I What else have you expected from globalists ? They need $$$. Classic grid was part of their infrastructure. So, you might have gone off-grid, but they still need $$$.  Do you think this is going to stop at panels ?  FYI - it isn't going to stop at money itself. Now, that they screwed up seemingly eternal Petro Dollar, they are working on forcing their CryptoShekel on everyone and on owning goods directly: \\ [Peter Schiff: The Day The Dollar died...]( \\ [Why Big Oil Conquered The World]( Controversial opinion(for this sub)but taxes similar to these are currently needed.   The cost of public utilities are averaged out into the daily rates everyone gets over a period of time.  For example if PG&amp;E is to install an energy storage plant it will split the cost over a period of let's say 10 years and add it to the daily rate of electricity based on the amount of customers it has. That's how public utilities have always worked. But now you have users that aren't paying the daily rate as often and are still connected to the grid. This scenario just forces those that can't afford or can't install solar to eat up the cost.   So it's either increase the rate of the average user or impose a tax on those that have their own solar farms,  the government will almost always side with imposing the tax.   Unfortunately a lot of public utilities aren't built for everyone to have their own solar farm. So it will only get more expensive until the proper infrastructure is there. Any method for the government to make money  !! I am glad to see CA residents suffer in this situation. They vote it and complain it all the time. The highest tax rate, highest gas price and ridiculous law against criminals. now pay the highest solar panels in the US. Desantis welcomes you to Florida. Give up.  Power companies will simply buy elected officials and make it a law.  There's no chance this gets defeated. California: ""Why are people leaving?""   Also California: ""Let\'s tax people to death""  On a serious note, we have a 16kW system (not in CA thankfully!), so we\'d be paying nearly half of what our electricity bill was in taxes in addition to what we paid for the system under that new rule. The people making these decisions are complete dumbasses who keep getting re-elected. When will it end, Californians? Why is this sub always ""CAliForNia GovT sO BaD"" ? Did they forgot when CA was rolling out incentives for solar and EVs, Ted Cruz and Greg Abotts and other Republican clowns were shilling for gas companies and decrying socialist Teslas ? There was so much controversy about DOE loan to Tesla and Solyndra. I mean even like last year during the Texas freeze, Cruz and other clowns were going on national TV and blaming solar and wind for the the embarrassing debacle. Literally the same incentive structure is now copied across the US and Abbott is now sucking Elon everyday.  This proposal is from CPUC, which is a reasonable conversation to start. It is the same as the EV fee to maintain roads. If solar is universal, but no one is paying to maintain the grid, how will utilities make money ? It is as simple as that. Fuck California. I'd rather we just run this shithole further into the ground. Drive off more businesses and people with money so that we have no one paying these ridiculous taxes and start the fuck over. Yet again under a Democratic regime they even want to take money from you while you try to do good for the climate change. When are people going to wake up to there antics. They want to live off of you while they find every loophole to not pay taxes. So its like have a electric bill again. Democrats suck! California wants your money.  They are reaching in your pocket and taking your hard earned money!  Meanwhile streets still have pot holes.  Your schools are terrible.  Your services are awful.  Where is all that money going? JFC, wheres the carbon tax already??? Dude, fuck California, and fuck government.  Its never enough.  They always want more.  Fucking bullshit. Your country is so fucking stupid lmao, you guys are in Cali and still can't even catch a fucking break from your state gov People seem to think that if everyone goes green the whole state/country can just opt out on some taxes. Theres no way that can work. If no one paying gas tax or energy tax then its gonna have to be made up for",47

Im quite baffled to see the difference of reaction from one user to another. Some people seems to be very happy with it, with 40 minutes drive without an issue. Some cant drive 3 minutes without an issue. Are the road so different from one place from another to have such discrepencies? When is it coming to the UK?! Yes, but where is the update? It looks like rollout has essentially stopped with only a fraction of people getting it. I'm still on 10.5. Seems the 10.9 roll out was halted (last time was for NHTSA I guess) but no communication to the beta testers as to what is going on. Such a vacuum of info. Looks like 10.10 has been paused. I guess that's another update I won't be getting. For some reason I pictured this person doing look mom, no hands as they passed all these people It would be cool if the software recognized other teslas so that they were not just grey blobs. Ha, Santa Cruz! Bonus points. Is that how the map always looks when you have the FSD package, but even when it's not in use? Driving in San Diego suburbs has exposed the limitations of 10.9 for me. It gets nervous and jittery when uncertain how to handle difficult situations. Example: handling a sharp turn in a road with more than one version of the double painted lines visible on the road. It eventually makes the right move most times but not before making the driver and passengers uncomfortable. My best guess is that it will be sometime in 2023 before it meets my simple criteria for successful release to the general public:FSD should feel like a professional limo driver is at the wheel. Anything less will represent a setback for the movement towards safer self-driving vehicles. What has been accomplished so far is amazing but far from complete. I hope Tesla does not ruin something great by releasing it before it is ready.",96,Don't get your hopes up. :( But the high beams will blind other drivers,1

Last month they said that they have 145 000 users. At $99 a month thats a lot of money each month. I got mine last week. They need about 10x that to start to turn a consistent profit. The first 5 months of service essentially pay back the loss on Dishy manufacturing.   Essentially 2.5 million users is the break even for 12,000 satellite network. 2.5 million users is about 250 million a month in revenue. To maintain about 12,000 satellites with 5 year use life is 2400 satellites per year or 200 per month so 4 F9 launches. Reports are that the satellites run about 500k each for the v2 laser ones. So 100 million per month for satellites and another 100 mil for launch costs at 25 mil per rocket launch and 50 sats in each, is 200 million. Then dish manufacturing, if we assume loss of 500 per dish and 50k dishs per month that would cover 600k dishes per year (new customers or replacement) at 25 million in cost over dish sale revenue. This works if you assume a user will keep service or dish lasts 4 years on average. That leaves 25 mil in net revenue per month after they recoup dish losses, most of which will be needed to cover operations cost.   I saw a report that indicates that 12k sats with an assumption of 20-25 GB/s throughput per satellite (currently about what they have, but I think it's improving and they were said to be targeting 50 GB/s on the newest sats) would give them the ability to handle 1.5-2ish million users in the US alone with a standard oversubscription rate of 3-4x. I don't know exactly what that translates to world wide, but you have to assume it's over 10 million users. At 10 million users on say 24k sats they would be looking at close to 300-400 million in profit per month.
