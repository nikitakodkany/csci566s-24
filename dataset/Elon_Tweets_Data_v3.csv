Hope you enjoy!  The Ultimate American: Tesla Motors  May 14th, 2013  There is usually a rhythm to how long it takes for a big innovation to pass through our lives. My first innovation that I was able to grasp was the computer, and soon after it, the internet. These two things transformed into the smartphone, of which Apple and Samsung were able to really take to the next level. Nowadays, I have the same feeling in my stomach that I witnessed in the aforementioned electrical revolutions, and I think that we are about to see another big step in innovation. The feelings of lust, wonder, and hope all culminate into one big ball of chemical reactions in my tummy when I’m faced with such changes. I’ve felt it with the computer, I’ve felt it with the internet, and I’ve felt it with the smartphone. What am I witnessing as these same feelings run rampant in my belly? Tesla Motors.  There isn’t one single reason why I say this. When something disrupts the way we live life the same way that the computer and internet did, there are two or three very different, but drastically better things that this new technology brings to our lives. It also usually starts at a small scale, but filters its way through the masses as the economies of scale and acceptability in our society take over. With Tesla, I see three major reasons (and many more smaller ones) that I think will take this car maker from industry darling to industry giant and beyond. These three things are cost of ownership, reliability, and its lack of dependency on oil. Now I know that the middle point is unproven due to the fact that Tesla hasn’t been around very long as a carmaker, but I will try to outline why I think this will become a reality.  Cost of Ownership  Let’s start the comparison by looking at the cost of gas. Starting the analysis with an average of $3.70 a gallon, and the average car getting about 25 miles per gallon, it costs about 14 cents a mile to run a car. Assume the average person drives 40 miles to and from work 250 days a year, and we have a total of 10,000 miles, which costs about $1,400 a year on gas. Add to this an oil change every 5,000 miles (ish) at about $30 a pop, and the total comes to $1,460. Add an alignment and tire balance because we care about the tires of the car, and the total comes to around $1,600. This of course doesn’t include a yearly emissions inspection, and the occasional faulty sensor, battery, pulley, chain, belt, alternator, transmission, clutch, radiator, catalytic converter, muffler, etc.  Using the Tesla Model S as our benchmark, the national average to charge the 85 kwh battery of the car costs about $9 at 11 cents (national average) per kwh. The 85 kwh battery used by the Tesla Model S is rated at 265 miles by the EPA (Tesla says it can go 300, but let’s use the EPA figure for this exercise), thus yielding a cost per mile of 3.4 cents. Comparing this to our average car, an ICE (internal combustion engine) is 4 times more expensive to run than the Tesla Model S. This extrapolates the yearly fuel expenditure of the Model S to about $340. Due to the fact that the Tesla doesn’t use a traditional engine, in that it doesn’t need oil, the roughly $60 a year it costs in oil changes disappears, in addition to the emissions inspection since there’s no tailpipe.   Keeping the alignment and tire balance maintenance in the numbers, we can peg the cost of ownership of a Tesla Model S at around $500. Another cost that will be reduced is the change of brake pads and calipers. Tesla cars, among other EVs (Electric Vehicles), use regenerative braking which uses the momentum of the car to drive the electric motor backwards and put power back in the battery when the driver lifts off the accelerator pedal. This slows the car down without the use of the brake pedal, which if mastered properly, can leave a driver to only use brakes to stop in emergency situations.  I would compare the potential cost of the sensors, pulleys, belts, etc in this section, but I think it makes a good segway for my next reason why Tesla will become a household name across the globe (and if Elon Musk has anything to do with it, on Mars too).  Reliability  Here’s where, in my mind, Tesla can really begin to separate itself from the cars that we have been driving for generations. In the previous paragraph, I promised to compare the costs of a traditional part swap of an ICE car, but the beauty is that a comparison doesn’t exist. The only significant moving part in the tesla outside of the axle and wheels is the electric motor, which delivers power to the rear wheels in the Model S. There are no belts and pulleys to drive the alternator. There’s no pumps and sensors to push the gas through the pipes and keep a balanced mixture of oxygen and gas. There are no oil and air filters. There are no cylinders being pushed and pulled by mini explosions in the engine. There’s no radiator to keep the engine cool. There are no fluids to lubricate and maintain temperature. There’s no catalytic converter to fail, muffler to puncture, transmission to drop... You get my point.   Now, this takes into account that Tesla’s architecture will be sound, but given the simple design of the car, and the engineers that design and work for Tesla, I would be very surprised if the above doesn’t become a serious selling point. It took years upon years to perfect the technology used in today’s ICE cars, and when you really think about the different parts that go into a regular gas car, it’s nothing short of a work of art. However, this work of art is complex, and complexity breeds a margin for error. Errors become inconvenient and often pricey, depending on the severity of the error. One could make an argument that the battery pack in the Model S is complex, and I will be the first to admit this. However, the key thing here is that there are no moving parts. It’s a delivery to electrons from the battery to the engine, and we’ve been using batteries for a considerable amount of time. The technology Tesla is using has been around, and that is a serious driver to my confidence in the reliability of the cars Tesla will put out.  Oil Freedom  Here’s the big one. Us Americans tend to be a prideful and stubborn bunch, and with good reason. We are the strongest economy of the world, with arguably the best Higher Education system and technology sector in companies such as Apple and Microsoft. In this respect, Tesla is as American as American gets. The cars are currently made in Freemont, California, made my Americans, tested by Americans, and sold by Americans. However, the biggest and most important fact to take away from this point is not that it’s made in America, but that it’s powered by America.  When you plug in your car, you will tap a variety of energy sources. According to Wikipedia, 51% of the energy in electrical usage is generated by coal, which is mined in the United States. The rest of it comes from a mixture of natural gas, nuclear and solar. Oil comes in at a measly 1%. When you fill up at a gas station, the petroleum often comes from a country other than the U.S. According to the EIA, 40% of oil consumed in the U.S. comes from imports. In addition, as Tesla continues its partnership with SolarCity, a solar panel company (of which Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the chairman), the dependency on CO2 emitting energy sources lowers. And yes, SolarCity is an American company.  This is where the true potential of Tesla lies. As the economies of scale take over, and the public warms up to the idea of having an electric car (which seems to be accelerating, with Consumer Reports giving Tesla’s Model S a 99 out of 100, its highest grade ever for a car), each person can make the case that they are a small part, but a part nonetheless, that helped make the United States energy independent. And they will be doing this paying about $340 a year on energy costs to run the car, without worrying about changing the oil, breaking a head gasket, or their transmission giving out ever again. Oh and by the way, if you use Tesla’s supercharger network, you can fill up your battery for free. So if you never fill up at home, you could theoretically pay $0 a year for fuel.   Tesla’s plan is to have a mass market car by 2017 that will cost around $35,000. If it can do that keeping the same efficiency and advantages outlined above, all the while expanding its supercharger network and perhaps introduce faster charge times and bigger batteries (which by all indications is in the not very distant future), Tesla will become unstoppable. The advent of a low maintenance car that is reliable, looks good, goes fast as heck (4.4 seconds 0 - 60 in the Model S performance), and will never have to visit a gas station never again should escape no one’s attention for an affordable mode of transport. Not only does it makes sense, but doesn’t leave many arguments to own an ICE car. I will be the first to say that I will always want to own an ICE car, but not because it’ll be more convenient. I’ve been a car guy ever since I played Gran Turismo for the first time on PlayStation when I was a little kid. My all time favorite cars are ICEs, but I can definitely see myself making an electric car my daily driver.  I see Tesla going the way of Apple and Microsoft. They have introduced the beginning of what I think is disruptive technology. If they continue to execute the way they have been so far all the way to 2017 before their mass market offering, I have absolutely no doubt that we will see the beginnings of a transportation revolution. We will see Tesla’s magic expand to public and private transportation all across the globe, all the while keeping its roots in the good ol’ US of A.   Lead by one of the most well known CEOs today in Elon Musk, I fully expect Tesla to do great things, and if they don’t, I will eat crow for the rest of my life. But something in my stomach tells me that won’t be the case. I’ve been in a trance for what feels like weeks ever since I started doing more research on Tesla. I’ve watched countless Elon Musk videos. I’ve read or viewed every single Model S review on the web. I’ve thought and speculated about the potential downfalls for the company. But what I always come back to is that it makes sense. It makes sense to own an electric car. Not because it’s an electric car and you are saving the planet per say, but because it’s cheaper to run, cheaper to maintain, and helps my community. And it looks good. And it’s fast. And it’s quiet. And it’s got a 17 inch touch screen. And until that day comes, that feeling in my stomach will continue to grant me sleepless nights at the thought of what could be.

For e.g. Patent #US8445126: ------  ------ A system and method for mitigating the effects of a thermal event within a battery pack is provided in which the hot gas and material generated during the thermal runaway of at least one non-metal-air cell of a plurality of non-metal-air cells is directed through one or more metal-air cells, the metal-air cells absorbing at least a portion of the thermal energy generated during the event before it is released to the ambient environment. As a result, the risks to vehicle passengers, bystanders, first responders and property are limited.  -----  Let us know what you think of that line of research.

And then... they got the email about the current sale Tesla is offering on showroom/loaner/test-drive vehicles ($1 off per mile, and 2% off for every month they owned the vehicle).   We went to the new store in Decatur, GA today (only open 4 days) to check out the ""list"" of the ones that would fit the sale. There were a few to choose from and one that my mom liked. It took a little convincing from me, but she put the reservation money on it and now are waiting to get it shipped up from Florida.   She ended up with a 2014, Pearl White, 19in wheels, black roof, tech package, and the textile upholstery. Not the fanciest, and probably the cheapest available, but still a Tesla. Certainly good enough to tide her over until they can get their Model X. Upon leaving, they gave her a little Tesla bag with a small, plastic Model S that was recycled from the scraps of plastic parts on the Model S. I ended up buying a coffee mug myself since I can't afford an S (waiting for the 3 for my wife and I).  Sorry for the long post. I'm beside myself with excitement right now.

As a way to procrastinate during college applications and exams I've been working on **[this simulation](https://github.com/jcreus/launchsim)**. Inspired by /u/TheVehicleDestroyer's launch sim from a while ago I've created a Python program to simulate F9 and FH going to space. The code is clean-ish and is extensible: one can easily add a new engine or a combination of stages. Cross-feed, while not yet implemented, should be trivial-ish to do given the current code structure.  That means we should be able to simulate the BFR using what Elon said in his AMA. The main problem right now is the launch trajectory (see below for more details).  Here's the Github readme.  **Acknowledgements**  https://github.com/murphd37/SpX for their amazing launch simulations and landing burn (which this repo does not simulate). Some of the code is based on their code, thank you very much :).  **Considerations**  * I'm a high school student, beware of bugs (and flawed physics) in the code! * Right now it doesn't do any kind of course corrections, just a gravity turn. This makes it much harder to simulate, because even a 1-degree difference in the gravity turn can mean that your rocket will point down (and you're not going to go to space). I've been trying to look for launch trajectory optimizations to a 200x200 km orbit but it seems a lot of it is under export control, so I cannot read it. I'll try to find and implement a trajectory, possibly by abusing Monte Carlo. * Coefficient of drag taken from murphd37's simulation (0.3), could be inaccurate. * Atmospheric model taken from a NASA website. * It uses RK4 integration.  **Conclusions**  * I was able to put a Falcon 9 into a 316x200 orbit with a payload of 13500 kg and some 5325 kg of fuel to spare. That translates to a total ""payload"" of 19t, which confirms the extra 30% margin for reusability that Falcon 9 has built in [we have to take the fairings' 1.75t weight to make ends meet, and we should also consider that these 5325 kg of fuel can be burned for extra payload and that the orbit isn't circular]. * Falcon Heavy seems to require a steeper gravity turn, right now it kinda works but to make it really work I'd need a correct launch trajectory (without course corrections it's incredibly hard to get a correct orbit!). * Now that we have some extra info for BFR we should be able to implement it with this code. It's a matter of creating an Engine() for the Raptor engines and creating the proper Stage()s to make the final Rocket() (see example code).  **Further work**  * Help would be appreciated on the launch profile/trajectory! * Implementing BFR would be cool!",52.0,51.0,"[{'score_comment': 4, 'created_utc_comment': 1420572845, 'body': ""Oh, if anyone wants to experiment with possible BFR designs (and possibly go full Kerbal Space Program) you can either modify the code yourself or tell me the specs and I'll implement it myself. Basically I need:  * Information about the engines (specific impulse and fuel flow).  * For each stage, its coefficient of drag, radius, dry mass, wet mass, engine type and number of engines.  Anyway, that should be easy to implement because the code is modular and easy to extend. The main problem is gonna be the course-correction-less trajectory. To run it, the dependencies are numpy and matplotlib if you want fancy plots. ""}, {'score_comment': 6, 'created_utc_comment': 1420576889, 'body': ""Great start. The trajectory problem is difficult and I don't have any advice there, but I have a suggestion for improving your drag calculation. The model you used is only valid for incompressible flow, which generally means mach number less than about 0.5. You can get a pretty good approximation however by just multiplying the drag coefficient by a number proportional to mach number as follows:  mach 0-0.8: 1   mach 0.8-1: -7 + 10m   mach 1-1.5: 6.6 - 3.6m   mach 1.5+: 1.2    Plot:   These numbers are off the top of my head having looked at a number of plots at various points in the past, but it should get you closer anyways.""}, {'score_comment': 7, 'created_utc_comment': 1420587442, 'body': ""AAAAAAHHHHH WHAT???!!?

Will definitely give it a look tomorrow as I'm just home and going straight to bed :) It's so beautifully compact though, man I should really learn Python...  Since, like my code, there's no nice user interface for the simulation, you should make some plots and create an imgur album for people to easily see exactly what the code does. Just a thought!  ____  Before I go I would share that for the whole course correction thing, I use the hazard maps to figure out what the magnitude and direction of the pitch kick should be (the booster stage should fall in the centre of the hazard area, more or less). Then I just do trial and error for course corrections during second stage flight. It's unique to each launch so unfortunately it's never as simple as you would like.  There is definitely potential for some really cool algorithm to pre-determine the corrections to end up in a perfectly circular orbit with as much fuel left as possible, etc. A genetic algorithm would be a very cool method.

This seems very likely. Predicting the motions due to waves more than a second or 2 in advance is all but impossible. Without the ability to hover and pick its moment to touch down, the first stage is very vulnerable during landing attempts. The Merlin engine cannot throttle down enough to allow hover. Perhaps the answer will be to make a slightly less powerful version of the engine for the center position. I believe the turbopumps can throttle lower, but the combustion chamber and bell do not allow lower thrust. A slightly smaller chamber and bell might allow hover, and save a little weight, with no other changes to the engine.  One of the things we can take away from this is that, if the landing attempt had been made back at Cape Canaveral, it would have had a much greater chance of success. No vertical motion, and there would have been a larger landing pad.

Now we are having to deal with the effects of our ancestors did, but we don\'t really have to deal with the effects of all the CO*_2_* that we\'re currently producing. It\'s our children and their children that will suffer for our shortsightedness. Our civilisation might be approaching a kind of maturity that will change the way future generations plan things and thing long term, but I think up until now, humanity has been very shortsighted and childlike.  Terraforming Mars will also be a multi-century effort. Nobody (even spacegeeks like me) would want to invest in terraforming Mars for centuries before we sent anyone there.

In what I\'ve just said, I was answering a slightly different question than yours, ""Would it make sense to begin terraforming Mars before going there?"" Mars is a big place.

As it stands the thin atmosphere offers little protection against solar/cosmic radiation and meteors, which will pose a continued threat to surface dwellers. However, effective terraforming would generate a thick atmosphere and magnetosphere which reduces or even removes those threats in the long term.    If they decide to terraform Mars, human participation will be essential, people are just indispensible for surveying in-situ resources, manufacturing, setting up and maintaining the necessary equipment required for terraforming. Yes colonists will be at risk from the terraforming process but in the long term they will be at greater risk from prevailing surface conditions if they decide not to terraform.  Terraforming could be accomplished relatively quickly (less than a millennium) using the same natural process used to terraform Earth. Earth's core contains a [georeactor]( which is a [natural fission reactor](  generating around a terawatt of power. After our planet was formed this reactor forced [huge amounts of water vapour and other gasses]( to the surface which then evolved into our seas and atmosphere. Our active core also helps to generate a healthy magnetosphere which protects us from solar/cosmic radiation and stops our atmosphere from being stripped away by solar wind, similar to what has occurred on Mars.  There is increasing evidence that Mars had oceans and an atmosphere - until its geothermal activity slowed. Hence to reverse the process (and terraform Mars) you will probably need to kickstart Mars' georeactor. Volcanic activity ceased on Mars around 100-200 millions years ago so large amounts of fissile materials/actinides should still be present in the core. If you follow the evacuated lava tunnels down then drill to the core, you can then load it with a relatively small amount of [uranium/plutonium, sourced locally from Mars]( Having replenished some of the georeactor's nuclear fuel the core should restart locally. A georeactor is essentially a fast breeder reactor, so it will start to make its own fuel, increasing the reaction rate and consequent power output. Within a relatively short time Mars' georeactor core should be restored and start pumping out colossal amounts of water vapour and gases trapped underground. These gases should be retained at the surface by a strong magnetosphere also generated by the increased core activity, possibly many times stronger than Earth's, which should help compensate for the reduced gravity.    Lastly, self replicating synthetic organisms would be required to convert the pyroclastic gases into a breathable atmosphere. This conversion process should increase exponentially as the organisms multiply, in a similar process to how our own atmosphere was [oxygenated by organic microbes]( 2.3 billion years ago.    Terraforming is a true mega-project, and however daunting, you need to dare to think big.""}, {'score_comment': 0, 'created_utc_comment': 1426386201, 'body': 'No. Zero sense.

Anyway, gonna copy paste it all here if that is ok;  April 15, 2015 7:13 am **SpaceX shoots down rival United Launch Alliance’s prospects**  Robert Wright in Colorado Springs SpaceX's Falcon 9 spacecraft, with the Dragon reusable capsule, sits on the launch pad on May 18, 2012 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket is being prepared for a May 19 lift off to hold systems tests and complicated maneuvers. The tests will confirm if the Dragon will be allowed to dock with the International Space Station. The most ambitious mission ever launched in the history of commercial spaceflight is scheduled to get under way at 4:55 am on May 19.   SpaceX, Elon Musk’s fast-growing US space launch provider, has dismissed plans by its main rival to revamp to handle growing competition, saying United Launch Alliance remains far from being a “real commercial provider”.  Gwynne Shotwell, president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, was speaking after ULA on Monday revealed plans for a overhauled launch system known as Vulcan.  ULA, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture that handles all US national security rocket launches, said the new system would enable it to cut launch costs. It also said it would achieve the groundbreaking capability to use successive launches of parts of a vast spacecraft then assemble the parts in orbit.  However, Ms Shotwell dismissed her rival’s claims. “I don’t know why they think they have an edge,” she said of the capabilities the new craft would provide. “I think we’re already better.”  Ms Shotwell was speaking to the Financial Times on the sidelines of the annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. Tory Bruno, ULA’s chief executive, had earlier expressed concern at the symposium about the financial effects of a looming decline in US military satellite launches.  SpaceX expects later this year to become the only ULA competitor certified to launch US military satellites, with the two poised to compete for all national security launches starting in 2019.  However, Ms Shotwell said SpaceX could accommodate a dip in government business because it had “lots of room” in other sectors it served, while ULA depended almost entirely on government revenue.  Mr Bruno said this week that the Vulcan’s average launch cost should be below $100m and that it would compete for commercial business. SpaceX offers some launches of its Falcon 9 rocket for as little as $60m.  “They have lots of strategising to do on how they’re going to turn themselves into a real commercial provider,” Ms Shotwell said of ULA.  SpaceX on Tuesday successfully launched its latest mission to the International Space Station for Nasa, the US space agency. However, it failed in an effort to recover one of the rocket’s boosters, which crashed on to an autonomous barge.  ULA’s supporters argue that its excellent reliability justifies its higher costs. The company has undertaken 95 launches since being formed in 2006 and suffered only one partial failure, when a satellite was put into an excessively low orbit. The orbit was later successfully corrected.  However, Ms Shotwell insisted that SpaceX’s record with the Falcon 9 — 17 successful launches, after Tuesday’s flight — was better than ULA’s. SpaceX lost a customer’s satellite in 2012 but completed that flight’s main mission, to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.  “We have focused on reliability from the beginning,” Ms Shotwell said. “We think we have a very reliable vehicle architecture.”  Ms Shotwell said SpaceX’s record and technology would enable it to become the most powerful operator in fields far beyond serving the US military.  “We will become the dominant provider of space launch,” she said.  #  &gt;However, Ms Shotwell dismissed her rival’s claims. “I don’t know why they think they have an edge,” she said of the capabilities the new craft would provide. “I think we’re already better.”  That is a very dangerous and so far unwarranted stance to take.

If you go by history, they absolutely do by record, but that isn't an edge moving forward. I dont buy ULA's reason for going for a fully reusable 1st stage because the break even is too many launches. I think they are not going that direction is a number of reasons. They don't use the multiple engine configuration of Spacex which allows only 3 then 1 engine to be used in the return, without this, landing a 1st stage is impossible as you cannot throttle rocket engines down low enough. It also appears they are not going clean sheet redesign, which would be needed to engineer the structure to handle reusability. Lastly, the coding required to pull this off must be extremely complex. Watching the Vine of the return shows how crazy adaptive and responsive the code and rocket needs to be.   In my opinion, if I am a ULA engineer, I see the writing on the wall. ULA has a very real possibility of going bankrupt in 10 years time as this Vulcan rocket needs to be something competitive in that amount of time. Spacex will be certified for the same exact government missions that ULA currently survives on. Spacex's CURRENT rocketry already is competitive, if not beats the Vulcan, and if projections hold, Spacex will be an order of magnitude cheaper than the Vulcan. Think about that....if the Vulcan was flying right now, it would not be a shoe in to be better than spacex's falcon 9.1 (it would be but not by a whole lot).

I know electric power was tried and abandoned early in automotive history, but I've heard battery technology has come a long way.  I went to the Tesla store and was surprised to find out it wasn't a local dealer. I would be buying from the big corporation itself and not supporting a local business like I was when I bought my diesel Jeep. The Tesla shop would not help with registration, license plates, inspection or even do much for me for trade in. What was the advantage to me? It just seemed like a ploy by a big corporation to keep more of the profits. I prefer giving my business to local car dealers who operate local businesses. Tesla only sold one car. I felt like I was a nail and I was at the hammer store. My Jeep dealer had all kinds of vehicles by different manufacturers. OK, so the dealership experience wasn't nice, how about the car?  I'm used to remote start on my Jeep. I enter a cool or warm car ready to go. There is a pleasant vibration from the engine – almost like a massage! The Tesla must be unplugged before you can even move one foot, and there is no massage option available in the seats. Well, the quiet in the Tesla is nice.  Diesel technology has been around for over a century and is well proven. I know the engine will last for decades and always be easy to repair. The Tesla depends on a bunch of batteries cobbled together with new technology and costing upwards of $30,000! Who knows if I'll be able to fix it in 10 years. Who knows if Tesla will lose subsidies and go bankrupt. Such is the risk Tesla drivers take. It made me nervous compared to proven, reliable diesel engine technology.  Operating a car with such a limited range made me appreciate the diesel. I never worry about using heaters or air conditioners. I have a 600 mile range. Maybe it drops to 590 if I use the air conditioner, but there would be no change to use a heater. I feel sorry for Tesla drivers in a cold climate! Every time I was sitting at a traffic light I knew I was burning up battery energy heating the car. Diesels are extremely efficient at idle and my range doesn't drop much while I keep warm at a red light.  But it gets worse! If I park a Tesla, I lose range every day. It is called vampire or phantom loss and can be as much as 1% a day. Can you imagine parking a diesel for 10 days and coming back to a 540 mile range instead of 600 because 10% of the fuel leaked out?   The Tesla people explained that electric charging is often free. Why just 100 miles out of my way is a “free” supercharger where I can get “free” electricity. What a silly gimmick I thought. My Jeep could have been sold for an extra $30,000 and I too could have “free” fuel for my car. There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch and driving a Tesla would make me feel ripped off since everyone else is getting the benefit of free supercharging, but not me. So I am paying more for a Tesla and others are getting the benefit. It is like being a 90 pound vegan watching a 400 pounder guzzle lobster at the all you can eat buffet. The diesel is more honest. I am an honest person and I am happy to pay my own way and not ask others to pay for my energy. The Tesla is a very heavy car that causes wear and tear yet doesn’t pay fuel taxes to support roads.  This isn't fair to other people. It also depends on a $7,500 tax credit to sell and lots of tax incentives in California and Nevada to run factories. This would give an honest Tesla driver guilty feelings: who wants to ask poor taxpayers to support your $100,000 car?  It is nice to recharge at home. If I came home with a depleted battery, I could plug in and be ready to go in only 10 hours. With my diesel I have to drive 5 minutes and spend 2 minutes filling with fuel, but I get 2 ½ times the range. Of course the cost of the electricity is just one factor: the 85Kwh battery in the car will degrade over time. Let's say that after 90,000 miles and 9 years I have to replace it. At $300/Kwh plus labor I could be looking at $30,000. That would add to my driving cost $.03 per mile or $3. (about the cost of a gallon of fuel) every 10 miles. So I should act as if I am getting 10 miles per gallon when I drive the Tesla.  I worried about the ecological impact of the Tesla. Efficient electric motors contain a lot of rare earth elements that are mined in China. Does anyone trust their mining operations to be ecologically sound? How about all the lithium batteries and lithium mining? Much electricity in the USA is made from burning coal. I sure would rather live next to an oil well than a coal mine and a coal power plant! Anyway, Carbon Dioxide from cars isn't the biggest contributor to greenhouse gasses, that would be methane from dairy farming, so I won't base my vehicle choice on CO2 output.  My biggest concern is safety. The battery pack is extremely heavy  and will make the car harder to control and slower to stop compared to a lighter weight car. Also worrisome is the impact to others if I hit them.  I'd rather be struck by a 3,000 pound ICE car than a 4,600 pound Tesla! Also, in the event of a crash, diesel fuel is non explosive and unlikely to cause problems. Lithium ion batteries are so dangerous that commercial planes flying with tons of fuel ban people from carrying batteries in luggage due to fire risk! Why would I want that in my vehicle! In the case of an accident what assurance do I have that I will be able to be rescued from my Tesla? The battery system operates at over 350 volts. I know that 115 volts can kill. What if somehow a rescue worker got shocked from 350 volts? I might be left to die in my wrecked Tesla! Lithium ion batteries and high voltage are scary things, unlike diesel fuel!  So with all these terrible negatives compared to an internal combustion engine what do you think I did? I accelerated in ""insane mode"" to 60 mph in only 3.1 seconds and I fell in love so I bought the Tesla.

Okay another thing is that you might be able to decrease the Stage 1 burn time - allowing staging to happen earlier and this way decrease the amount fuel needed land on the barge  since you accelerate less back down due to being not as high?  ...an increase in thrust sounds nice but I dont see too much of a value - especially in thelong term with relaunching - more thrust will decrease lifetime.  edit: okay another small advantage might be on the FH...you might be able to throttle down the core booster even more when the strap ons have a good enough throust/weight ratio...this might dramatically increase the performance - but thats not an issue today.'}]"

This suggests that the barges are here to stay, and not simply a feature of the landing development program. The numbers are sure to be different with more lofted trajectories and FH side cores, but it still seems that there is a much larger performance penalty than other phases of flight.  The re-entry burn is also an interesting unknown (at least to me) because it has two purposes: braking and protection. Another thing I\'m trying to understand is: what percentage of the deceleration is directly due to thrust vs. aero braking? In other words, you need a certain amount of thrust to create a ""bubble"" that protects the rocket from compression heating. Does the aero braking cause much more deceleration than the minimum thrust required, or is it inherently close to 1:1?  **EDIT:** I have answers, some of which are thanks to /u/FoxhoundBat\'s calculations and some cool graphs from /u/TheVehicleDestroyer\'s site.  The relationship between boostback (to barge), re-entry, and landing burns appears to be roughly [3/6ths, 2/6ths, and 1/6th respectively]( (for ease of envisioning fuel expended in relative proportion)  [Supersonic retropropulsion drag augmentation, relationship between thrust used compared to basic aero drag]( - thanks to [this video]( and spending a bit more time thinking about what the numbers mean.'}, {'score_comment': 1, 'created_utc_comment': 1448899426, 'body': 'How many more days before the new patch is revealed?

The vehicle had an apogee in the 220+mile range and a perigee in the -1600 mile range (orbit that was achieved being 124 x 124 miles). As the burn continued the apogee continued to decrease while the perigee increased. It was rather interesting to see those numbers play out. It was apparent that the apogee was the crafts actual altitude and was on the decent while the little RL10 puffed away to raise the perigee before it ran out of altitude. Meco happened right at the designed orbit. I had always thought that the first stage set the apogee and the second stage achieved orbit at apogee, like KSP.

How are launch operations carried out specific to fueling the vehicle? Will a ground operator have to manually fuel the vehicle and detach the propellant lines prior to take off? Will the boil off from the LOX during the 30-45 minutes from fill up to ignition be significant enough? Is there reservoir of LOX onboard the mothership that will be used to continuously fuel the vehicle during ascent? How will safety of the operators and pilots be ensured during fueling? Won\'t more stringent certifications and testing similar to human rating the vehicle need to be done as there are human operators during the first phase of the mission?

I had the thought that there must be enough of us heading down to watch the launch that a meetup might be fun.

It would be great to get together with a few people for a cookout, fun, and good conversation. If there's more than 5 or so people, maybe we can all bring some snacks/burgers and drinks/soda.

There\'s been a lot of debate here and elsewhere in the last few months about what a failure at this point could mean for SpaceX. Agreement has ranged between a pretty big setback to The End. There\'s been a million discussions about what could go wrong, a myriad of things that could go wrong in a normal rocket launch combined with the myriad of things that could go wrong after separation and S1 became it\'s own separate entity with it\'s own individual mission. There\'s been discussion and debate over what various failure modes could mean for the concept of reusability.  There\'s been a near infinite number of naysayers and detractors. From Jim on NSF to the randos that sometimes come here to talk shit, to the idiots on the SpaceX Facebook group talking about how the engineers are misguided, to industry professionals who through a combination of fear and unwillingness/inability to look forward have said this can never happen.  Tonight we have seen an unqualified success. There is nothing to point to and say ""but...""   Technically tonight is meaningless, landing a booster is a very expensive way to set a record that people all over the internet are arguing about already. We\'re just a hair closer to reusability than we were yesterday; after all a landed booster is only reusable if it lifts off again.   That said I suspect that December 21st, 2015 is a day that will forever be written in history. Today it is but a small step toward the future, but the history books may well write it as a giant leap for the survivability and progress of mankind. If reusability is possible tonight is our first step toward it. If low cost access to space is a reality tonight is our first step toward it. If humans can ever become a multiplanetary organism tonight is our first step toward it. If mankind is to continue our natural desire to explore ever further and every more harsh terrains tonight is our first step toward it. If the history books write what we hope they\'ll write far into the future tonight is going to be a singular point in time where people can point to and say ""that\'s where it started.""  Tonight we celebrate. All of the employees that have sacrificed so much to make this possible. Elon and Shotwell. Fans of space everywhere. A new generation who watched this in awe not even knowing exactly what this could mean for them.  Tomorrow is where we determine what tonight means. I, for one, am so excited for tomorrow, even more excited than I was when I cried seeing what happened tonight.'}]"

The payload and cost will vary in wide range depending on how many SRBs (up to 6). The payload will be similar to Atlas V and less than Delta Heavy. From 2023 new ACES upper stage should be available increasing payload above Delta Heavy at the same cost.  - Atlas V will probably continue flying into 2020s until Vulcan is certified. It costs around $160mil. It is unclear whether ULA is able to decrease it's cost while Delta is in operation and Vulcan is being developed (Delta heavy will fly till Vulcan is operational and certified for the heaviest launches). ULA might once again fly three different rockets at the same time.  - Falcon 9 cost is $61mil with enough performance to loft most satellites. Re-used Falcon 9 will costs about $40mil. Falcon 9H will cost $90mil for trajectories allowing re-usability and is able to loft also most heavy satellites.  - Ariane 62 will loft average satellite for $76mil after 2020  - Ariane 64 will loft two average satellites for $126mil after 2020  - Ariane 5 usually launches two satellites in one go (one average and one bigger) for $137mil.

""To the JSC Community:  I want to draw your attention to a blog published today by NASA Deputy Administrator, Dr. Dava Newman. This blog shares a variety of information about NASA’s Journey to Mars and our collaborations with a variety of stakeholders.  One of our partners in this journey, Space X, announced plans today to attempt a landing of an uncrewed Dragon 2 spacecraft, known as Red Dragon, on Mars as soon as 2018. NASA, including JSC, is providing Space X with technical support for this challenging mission. JSC is assisting this effort through the 2014 Collaborations for Commercial Space Capabilities Space Act Agreement, signed by NASA and Space X. Our Commercial Space Capabilities Office manages that agreement, which includes technical assistance on the Red Dragon Mission.  Our JSC’s Engineering Directorate is coordinating agency-wide support to SpaceX under its leadership role for the STMD/Game Changing Development Program/Propulsive Descent Technology Project to help the Entry, Deceleration, and Landing aspects of the planned Red Dragon technology demonstration mission to Mars.  SpaceX also is looking to NASA for expertise and critical assets in communications and tracking; mission design and navigation; entry, descent and landing evaluation and analysis; aero sciences; flight systems engineering; advice on planetary protection; and data transmission from deep space. In addition, SpaceX may be interested in additional knowledge-sharing, as they meet development milestones with their spacecraft.  This collaboration is important to both NASA and Space X. NASA's Journey to Mars, with sustained human presence, is a systematic, long-term commitment to human exploration of deep space. NASA's Journey to Mars is not based on a single landing or flyby of the Red Planet; it is a framework for the future human exploration of space during the coming century.

I've had kind of a hard time imagining what that would look like, but this note actually paints a pretty vivid picture, and I can't believe it's happening in 2016.

Prob ok, but some risk of tipping.""",5241,1251,245,Wild speculation time: Plasma aerocapture to aid in 1st stage recovery.,"So, watching the Thaicom 8 1st stage descent video last night, something occurred to me.  Several days back, I posted a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/4jsaec/niac_2016_phase_i_and_phase_ii_selections/) to the NASA NIAC 2016 report.  One of the more SpaceX relevant studies is the use of magnetically generated plasma aeroshells for planetary re-entry.  The study summary is [here](http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2012_phase_I_fellows_kirtley.html).  The much more detailed PDF for the (now completed) phase 1 portion of the study is [here](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/Kirtley_2012_PhI_PlasmaAerocapture.pdf).  &amp;nbsp;  TL;DR for those that don't want to read my wall of text: my calculations show that installing a system like this on Falcon 9 can completely **eliminate** the reentry burn and reduce the heating and wear of 1st stages by roughly a factor of **2** while **increasing** reusable rocket payload by about 1 metric ton.  &amp;nbsp;  **UPDATE**  /u/mitmsy pointed out a potentially fatal flaw in my analysis that probably kills this idea, at least for meaningful 1st stage recovery.  Since drag is a second order dependence on speed, the much lower speed of the 1st stage during reentry versus the Mars aerocapture.  (2.3 vs 5.5 km/s)  This means that the drag force generated by this system is much, much lower than I had calculated.  It's unlikely that it is capable of even dropping 100 m/s off the stage speed.  Unfortunately, this makes it marginally useful at best, probably a non-starter.    A few folks have pointed out that this would possibly be a way to do 2nd stage recovery and that's still possible, given the much greater reentry velocity.  But that's a much more speculative idea.    Sadly, a cool idea, murdered by a pack of ugly facts.  &amp;nbsp;  **UPDATE 2**  I reached out to David Kirtley, the PI for this project last Friday and he was kind enough to respond today.  His take was similar to the final conclusion here - the stage 1 reentry speed is just too low to be able to generate meaningful drag with this tech.  Stage 2 recoveries and planetary missions like Red Dragon could definitely benefit from it.  He offered to send me updates on the progress of the technology and if there's interest, I'll post them here in the future if there is SpaceX relevance.  &amp;nbsp;  Magnetic plasma aerocapture is a potential game-changer for Mars missions.  The study looks at a baseline 60 metric ton Mars lander and how to reduce fuel requirements for orbital capture and atmospheric entry.  Older studies required MASSIVE aeroshells to to the aerocapture, weighing 20 metric tons.  This newer tech simply has an electromagnet generate a magnetic field around the spacecraft.  A small amount of ionized gas is injected into the field, creating a huge plasma cloud that interacts with the upper atmosphere, generating drag.  In the study, it was calculated that the 20 MT aeroshield could be replaced by a 700 kg batttery/coil system, with the added benefit of dynamically variable drag, significantly decreasing mission risk.  In my post, there was some speculation about the relevance of this technology to Red Dragon.  The general conclusion was that is would significantly improve Red Dragon capability - decreasing the amount or retropropulsive fuel mass, increasing landed mass and allowing the trunk to be retained in stable Mars orbit as a bonus satellite.  The only downside that I could see was that this technology isn't sufficiently tested to use on Red Dragon.  However, that got me to thinking.  One of the most innovative things that SpaceX does is to use their paying missions to do prototype testing for essentially free - stage landing, etc.  Further, the stage landings are clearly dual purposed as dry runs for landing on Mars, given the atmospheric density that the reentry burns are conducted at.  In that case, it would make a great deal of sense for SpaceX to test out this sort of technology during 1st stage recovery to see if it would work for Red Dragon.  So I did some **very** rough number crunching this morning and came to a rather surprising result.  Not only would a magnetocapture system be a good thing to test during 1st stage recovery, it might actually significantly change how SpaceX does rocket re-use.  The magnetocapture system is actually capable of significantly reducing the 1st stage kinetic energy at altitude above the reentry burn.  The result is significant reductions in the amount of fuel required for landing the 1st stage and improved mass to orbit for all reused rockets.  Back of napkin math follows:  So, keep in mind that all of these calculations are horrifyingly crude and likely to be off be at least a factor of 2-3.  However, even with that in mind, it appears that the overall conclusion doesn't change much.  The NIAC study baseline looked at aerocapture of a 60 metric ton spacecraft at Mars.  The design calls for a 690 kg plasma magnetoshield system (this includes power susbsystems and a 30% mass growth allowance) that can generate 21 meter magnetic aeroshield.  (Summary is on page 57 of the PDF)  This aeroshield can generate a peak drag of 45 kN force at a Martian altitude of roughly 70 km.  This generates about 0.6G of deceleration force for the spacecraft.  Now lets look at the 1st stage.  According to [Spaceflight101](http://spaceflight101.com/spacerockets/falcon-9-v1-1-f9r/), the F9 1.1 1st stage has a dry mass of 23 MT.  I assume that the 1.2 1st stage is similar in mass.  I have no idea the residual fuel mass is for the reentry burns.  The 1st stage fuel/ox mass is 396 MT.  Lets assume that there's 10% of that fuel remaining at MECO.  That translates to a 1st stage mass of 60MT, coincidentally identical to that baseline study.    Now, the 1st stage is on a ballistic trajectory that takes it up and out of the useful atmospheric density for the magnetic aeroshield.  According to the study (PDF page 22), maximum drag seems to be at around 10^-5 kg/m^3 atmospheric density.  That's roughly 70km above Mars and 80 km above Earth.  Braking force rapidly declines and is down to ~1kN by the time you get to roughly 10^-7 kg/m^3 - 100 km above Mars/~120km above Earth.  Now, we don't have precise data for the trajectory the 1st stage takes, but the figures I could find seem to indicate that the latest GEO missions peaked at about 140 km altitude.  Does mean that a significant portion of the 1st stage trajectory is at an altitude where the system can generate significant drag.    Now, let's pull some numbers out of asses like a pervy Count von Count.  The study showed that the baseline could exert 0.6G of deceleration on a 60 MT mass.  Let's assume that the 1st stage is within the atmospheric density region where this peak drag can be generated for 15 seconds on ascent (right after MECO and stage sep) and 30 seconds on descent.  0.6G of acceleration for 45 seconds works out to roughly **300 m/s**.    I don't know what the total deltaV for the rentry burn is but the velocity at MECO for Thaicom 8 was 2.3 km/s.  I've repeately heard that the 1st stage does a mach 5 entry into the atmosphere, which is roughly 1.7 km/s(assuming 340 m/s for the speed of sound).  I realize the latter is incredibly inaccurate data, but lets just use that figure at face value.  That implies that the reentry burn is roughly 600 m/s.    In other words, adding a 700 kg magnetic braking system to the 1st stage, we should be able to eliminate about half of the reentry burn.  I don't know the fuel mass that is equivalent to but it's certainly more than 700 kg.  Now, let's look at potential improvements.  The study looked at a number of configurations (PDF page 55) for system mass and volume.  The study baseline was chosen to minimize system mass, assuming a relatively long pass through the Martian atmosphere.  However, the 1st stage has significant vertical velocity, limiting the time window it has to shed velocity.  Instead, some of the more massive magnetic systems that can generate more significant drag would be more useful.  The upper end of the designs weigh about 1 MT and can generate magnetic fields of roughly 50 meters in diameter.  These fields generate a peak drag of about 130N/m^2, meaning that the larger systems can generate peak drag of over 160 kN (vs 45 kN for the baseline study).  That's about 3.5 times the braking force we saw with the baseline - that's over 2G of braking force.  Assuming the same figures as the 700 kg baseline system, this larger system is capable of removing nearly **1 km/s** of velocity from the 1st stage.  That means that the atmospheric entry is now about 1.3 km/s rather than 1.7.  That's a factor of 2.2 reduction of atmospheric entry heating the stage has to deal with and a 1.7 fold reduction in airframe stress.  Not only does this eliminate the need for the reentry burn (and removing a full engine cycle off the 3 Merlins 1Ds), the 1st stage is now hitting the atmosphere at significantly lower speeds and much lower heating than we are getting with the current approach.  Further, by eliminating the reentry burn, we're removing at least a few tons of mass from the 1st stage, meaning that the magnetic braking is even **more** effective.  I'm assuming that the 1st stage has roughly 40 MT of fuel (10% of the total) reserved for landing.  The reentry burn seems to be about 3 seconds and the landing burn is more like 10-15 seconds.  That implies that about 20% of the fuel is reserved for the reentry burn, or about 7 MT.  The end result is that adding about 1 ton of mass to the 1st stage, we've eliminated several tons of fuel, an entire engine firing cycle and reduced the heating and damage to the rocket.  Assuming that each 5 kg of 1st stage weight cutting results in about 1 kg of additional payload to orbit, we've added a full metric ton of payload capacity as part of the deal.  (And that's 1 metric ton of capacity on a reusable launch, which is extremely valuable)  We've also managed to test a system which can significantly increase the capability of Red Dragon for essentially free.  This is something SpaceX should really look into.  A small, hundred kg system installed on  a 1st stage has a minimal impact on final payload capacity and can validate this approach for very little risk.  It's literally just a battery, some wire coils and a few kg of ionized gas that are injected into the field.  If the system works as predicted, future launches can then use a full-scale system along with a full landing fuel load as backup to see if the reentry burn can be eliminated.  If that works, then the reentry burn can be removed entirely and all that fuel mass can be put toward greater payload to orbit.  It's clearly a win-win if it works and can be tested at very low risk for SpaceX  edit- fixed some typos",139.0,235.0,"[{'score_comment': 23, 'created_utc_comment': 1464462980, 'body': ""Well that's awesome.

The Falcon-9 FT propellant mass is [409.5 MT according to this link](  We can work back fuel margins based on re-entry and landing burn times: for example the JCSAT mission had a re-entry burn time of 18 seconds, and a landing burn time of 10 seconds. That's ~28 seconds of 3-engine burn. Fuel mass flow rate is 0.26 MT/sec per engine - so total fuel consumed during landing (assuming 100% thrust) is ~22 MT.

I don't know the fuel mass that is equivalent to but it's certainly more than 700 kg.  Well, F9 FT has a thrust of 7,607 kN, and an Isp of 311 s. If 3/9 engines are lit, that's 1/3 the thrust. They could be throttling them down further, but then it would make sense to only light one engine. (Correct me if I'm wrong about any of this, and I'll update the estimate.) F=g0 * Isp * dm/dt, so solving for the mass flow rate we get  &gt; (7,607,000 kg*m/s^2 ) / (3 * 9.8 m/s^2 * 311 s) = ~832 kg/s  And the [latest entry burn]( lasts 18 seconds by my count. That implies roughly 15 tonnes of propellant, although if the engines are throttled down to 39% they would only consume ~6 tonnes. Not bad for a 700 kg magnetic breaking system, especially one that was optimized for mars EDL instead of this. Even if our estimates are way off, it's likely this could still provide significant mass savings.

Your source on the 23 tonne figure gives a range in the text:  &gt; can be estimated at around 23 to 26 metric tons, depending on the version used (earlier estimates ranged from 18 to 25 metric tons).  Can someone who knows more than me comment as to what a reasonable 95% confidence interval might be? It seems like we should be able to narrow it beyond a factor of 2. I haven's sat down and done the math myself though, so perhaps there really is that much uncertainty.

There's not much back-and-forth control   movement - which suggests that SpaceX has achieved a high degree   of control over the profile of the descent. - The grid fins are deployed early on, but there is no (or only very limited) grid fin    motion up until the re-entry burn, only RCS thrusters are used to control direction.    I believe this is done because before the re-entry burn the grid fins are only used    to increase drag and to stabilize the position of the rocket by having higher drag    at the tail of the flying body - but there's not enough drag yet in the thin atmosphere    to truly tilt or roll the rocket. - During most of the descent the first stage 'overshoots' OCISLY's position:   i.e. the rocket is intentionally angled beyond OCISLY's position, but is   still generally flying in the plane of descent. This is done way beyond what OCISLY   range safety considerations would require, see for example [this angle at ~90km   altitude]( - the first stage is    still pointing 100-200 km beyond OCISLY's position, beyond the retrograde    tangent of the trajectory. - But shortly before the [re-entry burn is performed](    RCS thrusters are used to line up the first stage to point almost exactly towards    OCISLY's position. (I believe this was done to point the thrust vector straight    into retrograde burn direction, to maximize the fuel-efficiency of the deceleration burn.) - After the re-entry burn was done **both** the grid fins and RCS thrusters were   used to move the stage [back into 'gliding position' again](    (I speculate that this dual control method was used either because at that    altitude the control authority of the grid fins alone is not strong enough yet,    or because the control software found it a high priority to do that re-direction    of the rocket.)  Previously it was assumed that the first stage was using itself as a lifting body to precisely control its down-range position. This is certainly true to a degree,  but looking at this position-marked video suggests that SpaceX has a high  degree of control over the profile of the descent and the position of landing,  and that the 'gliding' was possibly done for two other major reasons as well:  - to intentionally create lift to make the descent less vertical: the more horizontal   the stage can fly, the more time it has to slow down more gently while going   deeper and deeper into an increasingly thicker atmosphere, without taking major    damage. This is possible only to a limited degree before the re-entry burn,   because the atmosphere is still very thin and any lift is weak, but this effect   is much stronger after the re-entry burn has been performed. - to intentionally increase drag and thus to save fuel creatively: it's better to    not use RP-1 to slow you down, but to use the atmosphere. By now SpaceX likely    has a much better understanding about how much punishment the first stage can    take, and can use aerodynamically more aggressive approaches to use less fuel.  The above observations I think also explain that while the Thaicom-8 launch was almost a carbon copy of the JCSAT-14 launch (same MECO cutoff and speed, within 0.1%), still OCISLY was waiting 20km further downrange: the first stage was able to 'glide longer', and thus was able to both re-enter more softly and save fuel.  I'd also like to note that Thaicom-8 performed its re-entry burn 8 seconds earlier than JCSAT-14 did - and thus was able to do the max*_Q_* portion of its descent at about 20% lower kinetic energies than JCSAT-14. This explains why the Thaicom-8 lander still had its engine covers and generally looks to be in a much better shape than JCSAT-14 did.  The price was a slightly flatter angle of the final approach to OCISLY than JCSAT-14: and this could have contributed to the too high landing speed that crushed the crumple zone of a leg and tilted the stage slightly.  I suspect the Falcon Heavy center core, with its higher structural robustness, will be able to do even more of that to manage its speed without spending fuel!  As usual, these observations are highly speculative, please don't hesitate to point out  any mistakes and misconceptions! 😎  (Note to moderators: I hope it was fine to post this as a separate article!)  _*edit: smaller corrections*_""}, {'score_comment': 21, 'created_utc_comment': 1464442351, 'body': ""Interesting note about the camera itself - It looks like the glass/transparent cover for the camera cracked, just like on the CRS-8 landing video.

Theoretically, it may even be possible to decelerate from orbital velocities without a heat shield if you can expand your surface area to a very very high amount. This increases your drag significantly in the very rarified area of the high atmosphere so you get much less heating than you would if you were lower in the atmosphere.""}, {'score_comment': 4, 'created_utc_comment': 1464925750, 'body': ""Auti-steering back to where GoSearcher is located, would be awesome.

You really don't want the support ship spending a day or two fishing them out from a 30x30 km recovery box, rapidly widening due to ocean currents...  For example if one of the fairings lands in the middle of the Gulf Stream it can easily drift away at 6 km/h. In 10 hours it's already 60 km farther away, in 20 hours it's a 100 kms out - with an ever weakening radio beacon signal. So you absolutely want to concentrate the landing points of all two fairings in a relatively small area and recover them quickly.  Furthermore, during RTLS landings steerabale parachutes are probably mission critical: you don't want upper level winds to move them back over land in two scenarios:  - when launching from Vandy you don't want the jet stream upper level winds to blow the fairing back to California. (On Cape Canaveral the jet stream is typically blowing out to the ocean, so this should not be much of a problem there.) - or if your ascent corridor is pretty constrained in width like on Boca Chica, going near islands and oil platforms, you don't want the uncertainty of fairing landings widen the exclusion zone. The jet stream sometimes dips that far south and can blow both inland and out to the sea.  So I think steerable chutes are more than just about convenience of recovery, they might simplify Falcon Heavy fairing recovery logistics, and they are probably also mission-critical for launch sites that are not in Florida.  *_edit: fix logic fail pointed out by /u/Goolic below_*""}, {'score_comment': 1, 'created_utc_comment': 1464967826, 'body': 'A few thoughts and questions:  * Will recovery of fairings be used to find ways to build them more cheaply, and not just achieve economies due to reuse?  * Is there some cost point at which fairings could be made so cheaply that the economics of reuse would ironically be undermined?  * Are the fairing halves not attached to each other in some way to avoid banging against each other on descent?'}, {'score_comment': 1, 'created_utc_comment': 1464969656, 'body': ""Why not stage recovery helicopters on the landing barge? Have them take off at booster launch and wait for the fairings to drop In? Seems more direct to me. They'd drop fairings on deck then land alongside to be tied down.

But I believe many have missed the true significance of his tweet: I believe it is a strong indication that the [Mars Colonial Transporter (MCT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Colonial_Transporter) is going to be a lot more in addition to being a rocket capable of transporting people and cargo to Mars: once fully developed and tested it's going to be the **ultimate next generation, all around super heavy launch system**, and will be an eventual replacement for the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch systems.  Here's my reasoning why I think this is the most logical approach for SpaceX to pursue. We do know it from previous leaks and public comments by Elon that there are going to be at least three kinds of distinct roles of the MCT:  - 'Crew' transport capability: the MCT shipping 100 people to Mars - 'Cargo' transport capability: shipping 100 tons of cargo to Mars. Elon said: [""Goal is 100 metric tons of useful payload to the surface of Mars. This obviously requires a very big spaceship and booster system.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfq9be) - 'In orbit refueling' capability: refueling other MCT upper stages parked in LEO parking orbit. Elon said this about in-orbit refueling: [""if you do a densified liquid methalox rocket with on-orbit refueling, so like you load the spacecraft into orbit and then you send a whole bunch of refueling missions to fill up the tanks (...)""](http://shitelonsays.com/transcript/elon-musk-at-mits-aeroastro-centennial-part-2-of-6-2014-10-24) - We also know it from Elon that the BFR is going to be a single stage booster that will give the MCT upper stage enough velocity to reach orbit on its own, with over 230t of payload and then RTLS.  Based on SpaceX's existing specializations of the Dragon line into 'Crew Dragon' and 'Cargo Dragon' models it's pretty straightforward to hypothesize that based on the main roles Elon outlined the MCT is going to fulfill at least 3 distinct MCT upper stage 'models':  - The 'Crew MCT' upper structure will probably be large, well shielded but not very dense overall - ideal for hosting 100 humans. - The 'Cargo MCT' upper structure will probably be smaller but with less dry mass - to maximize cargo capacity. (It might not even have much pressurized volume - shipping that kind of cargo would be the role of the 'Crew MCT'.) - The 'Refueling MCT' upper structure might be almost non-existent: just a carbon composite nose cone to close it off - all the 'cargo' is in the excess fuel they have in their tanks when they reach orbit: about ~250 tons of it if the MCT wet mass is 1250 tons, or about ~20% of a full propellant load of an MCT!  Just like the Dragon I'd expect there to be a large amount of overlap and technology sharing between these builds of the MCT:  - The whole lower part of the MCT upper stage, the engines, tank structures and heat shielding might be completely identical: so these models would share 80-90% of their manufacturing complexity out of box. - The 'Crew MCT' might have a similar outer skin as the 'Cargo MCT', but with additional dry mass to provision for shielding, human environment (pressure) maintenance and living space compartments. - The 'Refueling MCT' might essentially be just the same as 'Cargo MCT', with the cargo hold replaced by a minimal nose cone.  But note that all of these spaceship variants look useful around Earth as well and are not narrowly specialized to Mars colonization purposes:  - If you can enter Earth atmosphere from high orbits and can land on Earth propulsively (necessary to be able to reuse and refuel the MCT) then you can do so on Mars as well: ""just"" the 'proportion' of the atmospheric entry, gliding and propulsive landing phases is different. - If you can ship 100 tons of cargo to Mars and can unload it there in near vacuum then by definition you can lift over 200 tons of cargo to LEO and can deploy it there in vacuum as well with comparatively little effort. - If you have a crew compartment that is comfortable for 100 people to travel to Mars in ~3 months then it's by definition comfortable enough for shorter duration space servicing trips around Earth as well! The MCT could service the Hubble (if it's still alive by that time) - or could lift 10 Hubble replacements into orbit ... - There's close to zero Mars-only dry mass on the MCT: Mars-specialist equipment like ISRU machines are probably going to be cargo, not permanent fixtures on the MCT upper stage itself. So there's no 'mass penalty' if the MCT is used around Earth for commercial jobs, or in the rest of the solar system for (paid) exploration missions. - (This is an edit to /u/EchoLogic's concerns below:) Unloading cargo on Mars, into vacuum and 37% gravity, in a fully automated fashion, without human intervention essentially requires an automated internal cargo/payload organization, movement and deployment system - which is essentially a next-gen payload adapter on steroids! Such a system is more than capable of deploying payloads into orbit around Earth as well.  It gets better than that: with full reusability of the upper stage even a full BFR+MCT launch, despite its huge mass, is going to be **significantly cheaper to launch than a current Falcon 9 launch**. (!)  The reason is that the Falcon 9 upper stage costs somewhere around ~10 million dollars - while even 5,000-7,000t of BFR+MCT propellant is going to cost much less than that, only around 2 million dollars.  What people don't seem to realize fully (yet) is that 'Mars' in the Mars Colonial Transporter is a name and a purpose, not a limitation:  By building a perfect Mars transporter and lander SpaceX will also build a perfect near Earth spaceship and a pretty good spaceship for many destinations in the solar system!  While Elon is mainly interested in Mars, Congress and NASA might want to fund:  - Manned Venus orbital and atmospheric sample taking and return missions become possible of box if the MCT upper stage has the speculated ~8 km/s Δv budget which it needs to enable speedy transfer to Mars . - Manned Moon landing. - Manned missions to the main asteroid belt and back. - Even a manned Mercury landing becomes possible with the MCT (if supported by 2-3 expendable Refueling-MCT spaceships)  All of these exploration missions become possible with the MCT, almost 'out of box'.  More importantly, to enable going to Mars SpaceX has to earn a *lot* of money - and what better way to do that is via building the ultimate super heavy space launch system architecture for the commercial sector, which also, by the way, happens to be perfectly capable of creating a city on Mars?  SpaceX might only want to finance Mars exploration missions (and near Earth commercial missions to earn money for their Mars missions!), but this does not make the MCT less capable for those other goals.  And I think last year Elon also indicated that they are thinking about MCT not as a Mars-only branch, but as a successor to the Falcon and Dragon: [""The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. [...] Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfq5qf)  Once all of these super heavy lifting capabilities are demonstrated I'm pretty sure paying customers are going to form a long line all the way to the next block.  ****  **TL;DR**: I believe the main reason why, despite being tempting, it makes more sense for SpaceX to concentrate on the Mars rocket and not extend the Falcon Heavy upper stage with reusability is that the MCT is the main and **sole** future spaceship line SpaceX is concentrating on, which will not only get humanity to Mars but is going to service all the commercial space jobs around Earth and the solar system as well, and it will replace the Falcon 9 / Falcon Heavy launchers in time.",275.0,345.0,"[{'score_comment': 63, 'created_utc_comment': 1468919076, 'body': ""This is an interesting post. It examines a number of possible scenarios regarding the outline of MCT, and the envelope of its capabilities pertaining to spaceflight. It misses one thing though, in my opinion.  **The business logic.**  Don't get me wrong; this is an idealistically perfect outcome for MCT from a spaceflight-oriented fan perspective. But I think a number of fans are getting carried away here - including yourself. In fact, MCT+BFR could be quite conservative, at least initially, compared to some fan predictions. Indeed, I hope it is!  Risk is a huge part of doing business. The more complicated you make something, the greater your chance of failure (define failure?) you could incur, and the greater that failure can be. Risk and failure are certainly correlated, and anyone who takes even a basic economics course covers this sort of thing as part of their education. [Elon Musk has regrets about how the Model X was developed, and how it was managed]( indeed, if we ever learn more about that saga, it could become a fantastic business case study of a near-failure that was saved be genius. I really hope for the sake of schedule-reliability and all round sanity, MCT+BFR is carefully crafted and considered.   For this reason, *I suspect BFR+MCT will be a groundbreaking design, but to reduce capital investment cost, risk, and schedule concerns; it will be rather simple (comparatively)* - elegant might be a better word.  # What do we know?  * **Falcon 9 &amp; Falcon Heavy are fantastic vehicles.** The do their jobs well, and they do it reliably. There is no good reason to shorten their lifespan just yet. Sure, BFR could serve as a replacement one day, but why design that functionality immediately when you have 2 perfectly acceptable vehicles anyway?     If this drives up costs in a significant way (which it could definitely do), they cannot afford to have a cash squeeze here. If there is a whiff of speculation SpaceX has bitten off more than they could chew, investors could pull out, or it could be harder to find new sources of income (launching Falcon won't be enough to cover the shortfall). A similar scenario to this is described in Ashlee Vance's Musk biography.  * **Building rockets is expensive. Sending people to Mars is more so.** They will need all the capital they can get. You therefore, obviously, have an intent to minimize overall expenditure.       It's this reason why I believe MCT+BFR **will not be capable of carrying payloads** into orbit. BFR is the first stage, MCT + a refueler design is the second stage. *There is no fairing, there is no payload adapter*. It's a least initially a waste of time and money (opportunity cost is a thing!) to shoehorn that sort of functionality into an architecture designed for Mars.       BFR+MCT *should be* a dovetail of perfect, unifying focus with one goal: getting to Mars. Even if it's at the expense of fans' dreams. You need to save every penny and every bit of mass to make this work and make it cheap.  # And what does BFR+MCT need to be?  * **As simple as possible.** This means constraining it to as few launcher configurations as required. Three is simply too much. There's MCT and a refueler. It's a *Mars* architecture after all. If someone else wants to build a generic second stage which can sit atop the BFR stack - fine, that'd be lovely. But they need to stay focused here.  * **It needs to optimize for mass beyond belief.** Even at these scales, I disagree that this is a problem that can be solved by strong-willed desires to add more propellant and brute thrust. Any extra mass in an MCT/Refueler design to make it reconfigurable for pure cargo payloads outside of the realm of Mars are in my mind unachievable at this point in time.   * **A *Mars* Colonial Transporter**. Like, it's in the name - and I do think it's a well considered limitation. Mars is realistically the only business case in space that makes sense (if you agree with Musk's statements about asteroid mining not being a feasible goal) - designing it for even more speculative markets is not a rational business decision.      I'm a software guy. Writing software sucks. If there's anything I feel like in software engineering is applicable to *actual* engineering, it's that refactoring things is hard. Concrete classes, concrete methods, probably even real concrete. Designing a perfect system without writing a line of code is a very hard thing to do, and is seldom accomplished. It's difficulty increases as a function of scope. Falcon 9 was refactored at least twice (that we know about!). We can't afford to see MCT+BFR refactored, which again comes circling back around to risk.   What it does not need to be is a general purpose launcher. All these things you propose will happen in time. But I pray it's not a Model X. Even BFR will be one small step, but one giant leap for mankind.   ___  **TL;DR**: While it's great to dream about what MCT/BFR might be, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves.

There is a risk/reward calculation to be done here. What are the chances of FH being easy to operate and staying on schedule? It has a pretty poor track record for staying on schedule so far, and the complexity issue has many unknowns.

The F9 and FH won't be initially obsolete by launches by BFR, but eventually will eclipse them.  Each respective platforms have an eventual shelf life where SpaceX is better suited with focus and resources on BFR/MCT.  At some point if there is a need to have a smaller launcher than the BFR, say for sat launches that are smaller and BFR being too expensive (and other companies aren't really developing there) I think you will see a 1-3 engine fully Raptor powered Methane Falcon than continual manufacturing of F9/FH RP-1 with Merlins.  This Falcon Raptor (FR or FR3) will be made as a replacement to the F9/FH but as an evolutionary decedent of BFR rather than F9/FH getting spliced with some BFR tech.  I dont know the speculated thrust levels of Raptor off-hand but a 3-4m version similar to the size of the F9 with resuablitiy for both stages (or just make 1 big stage if low level throttling) seems acceptable based on where I could see the market by 2025-2030.

More MCT speculation.  I think MCT will not be 3 spaceships but just two- a tanker and a crewed version.  For the refueling mission you remove the heat shield and for the crew module you simply replace one of the fuel tanks deep inside the vehicle and turn it into a habitation module.  This means no crew escape module so no launching of people on the MCT.  People will be launched on Dragons and Falcon 9 or possibly an enhanced Dragon on a Falcon Heavy.  Then they meet up in orbit when the MCT is fully fueled.  The heat shield is on the top of the vehicle which performs a ""skip entry"" on Mars, does a 180 degree turn in the upper atmosphere and then lands like a Falcon 9.  The Dragon separates in High Mars orbit and loops around Mars and back to Earth for a splashdown.  As far as launching other stuff using the MCT I don\'t see it unless somebody decides to build a 15 meter wide 2nd stage.  MCT will be designed to barely get into orbit where it is refueled.  At best you would have a capacity launch the weight of the crew compartment on MCT which is what?  100,000 pounds?  Of course if you also refuel it on orbit, then you can take that 100,000 pounds to just about anywhere in the solar system.  The other notion is using BFR as in effect a SSTO to launch a payload as big as MCT to LEO.  That is 250,000 pounds or more.  I am no rocket but I suspect this is much easier to do than designing an entirely new second stage and gives you a lot bigger bang.  I wonder if you could simply make a cargo space by taking out everything in the MCT except the outer (15 Meter) ring and leave a huge internal volume for satellites and a deployment mechanism?

If it can do that, it can put 100 people into LEO for a day or two (or rather longer).  To hell with servicing trips!  Even if your estimates are wrong, and it costs more than a falcon9 launch (say, 100 million dollars), that's about 1M per ticket (and here we are still twice Elon's target price for getting people all the way to Mars).  How many tourists could you get for 1M per ticket into low earth orbit for a week?  How much for a cruise around the moon (with a higher ticket price  to cover in-orbit refueling)?

The FH can run all F9 missions with the added bonus of more payload and all ground pad landing. Most F9 missions will not be ground landed and SpaceX is only 1 for 3 in a retrievable and immediately reusable core from water landings. While they can probably bring this success rate up it's pretty clear from a risk stand point that they are better off trying for ground landings. My pet theory is that center core FH will be F9 cores that are near the end of their life cycle or require lots of remanufacturing because of a bad landing. This allows the two boosters to be reliably landed on the ground and the reman/end of life cores landed at sea, and if they have a bad landing they just get pushed off the deck into the ocean. The only time we will see F9 use is with the narrow window of missions that have no need of a heavier payload and can still be landed on the ground such as dragon missions.""}, {'score_comment': 2, 'created_utc_comment': 1469144388, 'body': ""Not sure if I agree with the linkage to the tweet but upvote for a well thought out post.

In the last 2 weeks I've had a new owner, (I know this because its has the new front end and the license plate has Sept stickers.)  who has been abusing our destination charger.  Last week when I first met this person, helping her back her Model S P90  into our lone Tesla parking slot, she informed me she was low on miles and needed few miles to get home.  Not a problem happens all the time here in the middle of nowhere. Let her charge up asked her if she needed to come inside while she grabed a few miles she said she'd just sit in her car.  That was last week.  Now to the problem. This week at least the last 5 days M-F when I'm in the building her Tesla has been parked in our lone charging spot 3 days out of 5. Shes not in it, shes never stepped in and talked to any of my employees. There is just her Tesla S just sitting there sipping my power ($) and its not available for anyone in need of actual top up since as of just today, its been plugged in for 7+ hours and she has not come to pick it up yet.    I haven't been able to catch her as she stops to collect her car this week but this is out of control. I believe I am being taken advantage of, I know, from that lone 30 second interaction during what I believe was her first visit here, that the town she drives to from her home has multiple charging options.    So I since I havent been able to catch her to talk it over I've had to resort to a passive aggressive sign and posted it above our Wall Charger. It reads as follows.   * I've removed what I hope are the identifying info from the sign text so if I'm in the wrong I don't bring a $hit storm down on my little family business hope you understand but one can never know how the internet will react. So here's the TEXT  * Destination Charging Station  We are a destination charger, first and foremost we are here for customer use, Come in take a tour, Enjoy our products  Worried about getting over to RESORT TOWN?? No problem stop grab some miles, careful driving over the pass, Ohh by the way we have a tasting room IN RESORT TOWN HERE'S THE ADDRESS  Late Night and you really have no idea where you are?? Charge up there's a LOCAL MOTEL about a ¼ mile south on HWY careful walking along the road.  What we are NOT is a place for you to charge up every other day for a week when you've never stepped foot into our building.    $10 per day charge if you would like us to fill the hole in your day to day transportation plans  So what do you think? I hate to be so mean but there are multiple options for her to charge up in the Resort Town she drives too, parking her Model S here deprives us of our ability to offer people some reassurance to any range anxiety they may have trying to get to Resort Town from the closest Super Charger.    EDIT: SHE SHOWED UP   So she came and got her car a bit ago, I also had the local sheriff there talking to me about what to do when she pulled up. Got a sob story about her apparently being split with her husband/spouse/BF whatever. From the story I think she thought she could just park it there just like it was her own garage. I told her they make a 110V adapter so she can charge at her mothers house who's car she had shown up in. She was pretty clueless about her car in general which I kinda had already know from my first 30 sec interaction.

The New York Times discussed how this combination would help CEO Elon Musk move toward his aspirations for greater clean energy use. But the Los Angeles Times took the companies to task for merging in the face of tremendous capital needs at both, while Tesla was far short of hitting its goals for auto and battery production.   Since then the press has been almost wholly negative on the merger. Marketwatch‘s Barry Randall wrote that the deal makes no sense. He argues the companies are in two very different businesses that are not synergistic – and he analogizes this deal to GM buying Chevron. He also makes the case that SolarCity will likely go bankrupt, so there is no good reason for Tesla shareholders to “bail out” the company. And he argues that the capital requirements of the combined entities are unlikely to be fundable, even for its visionary CEO.  Fortune quotes legendary short seller Jim Chanos as saying the deal is “crazy.” He argues that SolarCity has an uneconomic business model based on his analysis of historical financial statements. And now Fortune is reporting that shareholder lawsuits to block the deal could delay, or kill, the merger.  But short-sellers are clearly not long-term investors. And there is a lot more ability for this deal to succeed and produce tremendous investor returns than anyone could ever glean from studying historical financial statements of both companies.  GM buying Chevron is entirely the wrong analogy to compare with Tesla buying SolarCity. Instead, compare this deal to what happened in the creation of television after General Sarnoff, who ran RCA, bought what he renamed NBC.  The world already had radio (just as we already have combustion powered cars). The conundrum was that nobody needed a TV, especially when there were no TV programs. But nobody would create TV programs if there were no consumers with TVs. General Sarnoff realized that both had to happen simultaneously – the creation of both demand, and supply. It would only be by the creation, and promotion, of both that television could be a success. And it was General Sarnoff who used this experience to launch the first color televisions at the same time as NBC launched the first color programming – which fairly quickly pushed the industry into color.   Skeptics think Mr. Musk and his companies are in over their heads, because there are manufacturing issues for the batteries and the cars, and the solar panel business has yet to be profitable. Yet, the older among us can recall all the troubles with launching TV.  Early sets were  not only expensive, they were often problematic, with frequent component failures causing owners to take the TV to a repairman. Often reception was poor, as people relied on poor antennas and weak network signals. It was common to turn on a set and have “snow” as we called it – images that were far from clear. And there was often that still image on the screen with the words “Technical Difficulties,” meaning that viewers just waited to see when programming would return. And programming was far from 24/7 – and quality could be sketchy. But all these problems have been overcome by innovation across the industry.  Yes, the evolution of electric cars will involve a lot of ongoing innovation. So judging its likely success on the basis of recent history would be foolhardy. Today Tesla sells 100% of its cars, with no discounts. The market has said it really, really wants its vehicles. And everybody who is offered electric panels with (a) the opportunity to sell excess power back to the grid and (b) financing, takes the offer. People enjoy the low cost, sustainable electricity, and want it to grow. But lacking a good storage device, or the inability to sell excess power, their personal economics are more difficult.  Electricity production, electricity storage (batteries) and electricity consumption are tightly linked technologies.  Nobody will build charging stations if there are no electric cars.  Nobody will build electric cars if there are not good batteries.  Nobody will make better batteries if there are no electric cars. Nobody will install solar panels if they can’t use all the electricity, or store what they don’t immediately need (or sell it.)   This is not a world of an established marketplace, where GM and Chevron can stand alone. To grow the business requires a vision, business strategy and technical capability to put it all together. To make this work someone has to make progress in all the core technologies simultaneously – which will continue to improve the storage capability, quality and safety of the electric consuming automobiles, and the electric generating solar panels, as well as the storage capabilities associated with those panels and the creation of a new grid for distribution.  This is why Mr. Musk says that combining Tesla and SolarCity is obvious. Yes, he will have to raise huge sums of money.  So did such early pioneers as Vanderbilt (railways), Rockefeller (oil), Ford (autos), and Watson (computers). More recently, Steve Jobs of Apple became heroic for figuring out how to simultaneously create an iPhone, get a network to support the phone (his much maligned exclusive deal with AT&amp;T), getting developers to write enough apps for the phone to make it valuable, and creating the retail store to distribute those apps (iTunes). Without all those pieces, the ubiquitous iPhone would have been as successful as the Microsoft Zune.  It is fair for investors to worry if Tesla can raise enough money to pull this off. But, we don’t know how creative Mr. Musk may become in organizing the resources and identifying investors. So far, Tesla has beaten all the skeptics who predicted failure based on price of the cars (Tesla has sold 100% of its production), lack of range (now up to nearly 300 miles), lack of charging network (Tesla built one itself) and charging time (now only 20 minutes). It would be shortsighted to think that the creativity which has made Tesla a success so far will suddenly disappear. And thus remarkably thoughtless to base an analysis on the industry as it exists today, rather than how it might well look in three, five and 10 years.  The combination of Tesla and SolarCity allows Tesla to have all the components to pursue greater future success. Investors with sufficient risk appetite are justified in supporting this merger because they will be positioned to receive the future rewards of this pioneering change in the auto and electric utility industries.'}, {'score_comment': 7, 'created_utc_comment': 1474746017, 'body': ""At this moment (Sept 24, 2016):  * SolarCity ([SCTY]( is selling for **$19.24/share** * Tesla's ([TSLA]( offer is 0.11\\*207.45 = **$22.82/share**  So shares of SolarCity are selling for about 19% below what Tesla will pay for them if the shareholders approve the deal.

The conundrum was that nobody needed a TV, especially when there were no TV programs. But nobody would create TV programs if there were no consumers with TVs.""  In other words, it\'s a chicken and egg problem - the electric car (and stationary storage) isn\'t viable without solar power, and solar power isn\'t viable without electric cars.   Huh? Tesla cars are obviously viable without solar power, and solar power is viable without electric cars. (same for stationary batteries - they can reduce the need for peaker plants, no matter if there is PV on the grid). Both rely on the existence of the electric utility industry, but that\'s been around for a century.   To sum up the article in two sentences ""Tesla and Solar City isn\'t like the auto and oil industries, where each one supports the other, it\'s like TV manufacturing and TV programming at TV\'s inceptions, where neither one worked without the other. Here\'s the evidence for why Tesla and Solar City support each other""  I just wish we could get more honest and insightful reporting on this stuff. What savings potential is there by putting all of these things on one inverter? How likely is an EV owner to have rooftop PV versus the population at large? How important is the data about solar power generation to making a good algorithm for managing batteries to maximize their dollar value, and can Tesla get that data by providing the inverter without doing the solar itself? What are the opportunity costs for Tesla in the deal - what else could they use the money for, and what advantages would it bring?  I\'m belaboring the point here, because it\'s a pet peeve of mine, weak but easy-to-make arguments that rely on people\'s interest in the company to get clicks, rather than cogent analysis that helps readers understand things.

The more you dedicate to grid stabilization, the more $$ you get from Tesla.  * Integrated two-way inverter allows Tesla to monitor the voltage sag, phase/frequency, and voltage spikes. Each battery installation is essentially a grid sensor, feeding data into the Tesla ~~hivemind~~ central server. Ditto with EVs during charging, as well as Supercharger installations. Data is king.  * If EV charging is involved, it will be with a direct DC feed to the car. A DC-DC converter (more efficient than DC-&gt;AC-&gt;DC) takes power directly from the solar panels or Powerwall and puts it into the vehicle battery. It can also charge your EV when the Powerwall battery is full, in places without net metering. Yet another use for the DC bypass ""Supercharger"" hardware. :D  * EV backup during power outages. Since it\'s hooked straight to the Powerwall, it has all the necessary grid safety interconnects for V2G. ""Zombie apocalypse"" proof system.

Here's the link: https://powerwall.tesla.com/  Elon says that it will start on time because of the timing with the sunset (6:03pm). If no one can, maybe the sun can make Tesla/Elon start an event on time.  As previously confirmed by Tesla, Powerwall 2.0 and a new solar roof product are expected to be unveiled. Last month, Elon also talked about a ""new Tesla charger"", but it was left out of recent comments about the event by both Musk and Tesla so it's not clear if it's still in the plans at this point.

The more you dedicate to grid stabilization, the more $$ you get from Tesla.  * Integrated two-way inverter allows Tesla to monitor the voltage sag, phase/frequency, and voltage spikes. Each battery installation is essentially a grid sensor, feeding data into the Tesla ~~hivemind~~ central server. Ditto with EVs during charging, as well as Supercharger installations. Data is king.  * If EV charging is involved, it will be with a direct DC feed to the car. A DC-DC converter (more efficient than DC-&gt;AC-&gt;DC) takes power directly from the solar panels or Powerwall and puts it into the vehicle battery. It can also charge your EV when the Powerwall battery is full, in places without net metering. Yet another use for the DC bypass ""Supercharger"" hardware. :D  * EV backup during power outages. Since it\'s hooked straight to the Powerwall, it has all the necessary grid safety interconnects for V2G. ""Zombie apocalypse"" proof system. A single DC-DC converter could conceivably be used for PV-&gt;Powerwall, Powerwall&lt;-&gt;grid, PV-&gt;car, Powerwall&lt;-&gt;car, and car&lt;-&gt;grid (since you\'re only doing one at a time), but they might use two instead.

The call for a hold was made at T-13 seconds by Elon himself, and SpaceX got approval for a 24 hour recycle. This launch attempt will be about twenty minutes earlier than yesterday’s.  ---  **[See this stream for countdown](http://original.livestream.com/spaceflightnow)**  ---  ### Information on the mission, launch and landing.  It’s the *1st* launch out of Launch Complex 39A since [STS-135 in 2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3deA3BXAnHs), and SpaceX's first East Coast launch since JCSAT-16 in August 2016. Some quick stats: this is the **30^th** Falcon 9 launch (using the B1031/F9-032 core), the **10^th** Falcon 9 v1.2 launch, the **1^st** launch of the Falcon 9 from Pad 39A, and the **2^nd** launch since SpaceX suffered an anomaly during their AMOS-6 static fire on September 1, 2016. This mission’s static fire was completed on February 12^th.   SpaceX is currently targeting a **February 19, 2017 09:38:59 EST / 14:38:59 UTC** morning liftoff from KSC, lofting Dragon and 2,490 kg of cargo into low earth orbit. This will be an **instantaneous launch window.** After insertion into orbit, Dragon will maneuver its way to the ISS, rendezvous, and then dock. After staying four weeks berthed to the station, Dragon will then undock, deorbit, and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California. This is mission 10 of 20 under the first round of NASA's Commercial Resupply Services contract. The weather is currently 70% go.  The secondary mission objective is also exciting! SpaceX will attempt to land the first stage of Falcon 9 back at Landing Zone 1 in CCAFS, on the site of the old Launch Complex 13. This would be the third successful landing at LZ-1, and the first daylight RTLS landing, marking the advent of SpaceX’s latest [CGI technology.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/832480331496185857)  ---  ### Pre-Mission Coverage  Spaceflight Now has been running a [constant video stream](http://original.livestream.com/spaceflightnow) of LC-39A for the past week, so until SpaceX and NASA coverage (listed below) begins, this livestream is the best option for keeping tabs on the pad.

This CRS mission is carrying several important science experiments to the ISS. In the trunk we have the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) III and the STP-H5 Lightning Imaging Sensor. SAGE III is a fourth generation experiment; it will measure stratospheric ozone, aerosols, and other trace gases by locking onto the sun or moon and scanning a thin profile of the atmosphere. The STP-H5 Lightning Imaging Sensor will be measuring frequency and intensity of lightning strikes around the world. One can find more information about these experiments along with other science carried on this mission [here.](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/spacex_crs-10_mission_overview.pdf) In addition to the 960 kg SAGE III and STP-H5, Dragon will carry 1530 kg in the pressurized section full of experiments (including the mousetronauts!) and supplies for a total cargo mass of 2490 kg. Total mass for this mission is slightly more than the previous mission (CRS-9), by 233kg. CRS-9 carried a little more in the pressurized section of Dragon while this mission will be carrying twice as much weight in the trunk.  After being inserted into the highly inclined orbit of the International Space Station, Dragon will spend several days rendezvousing with the ISS. Following that, Dragon will slowly be guided in by the manually-operated Canadarm for its berthing with the station at the nadir port of the Harmony Module. Dragon will spend approximately a month attached to the station before it is loaded with ground-bound experiments and unberthed for its splashdown in the Pacific Ocean roughly 5.5 hours later.   ### Secondary Mission - First Stage Landing Attempt  As usual, this mission will include a post-launch landing attempt of the first stage. Most landing attempts use an Autonomous Spaceport Droneship, either *Of Course I Still Love You* or *Just Read the Instructions*, but this mission has enough fuel margin to return all the way back to land, where it will touch down on the LZ-1 landing pad just under 15 kilometers south of the LC-39A launchpad.  You can read about how the landing process works [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceX/wiki/faq/reusability) If you have any more questions about the process, feel free to ask them here or in the [Spaceflight Questions &amp; News thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/5rcyea/rspacex_spaceflight_questions_news_february_2017/) If the landing is successful, it will be **8^th** successful landing SpaceX has made, the **3^rd** at LZ-1, and the **7^th** successful landing to take place on the East Coast. Assuming a successful outcome, the high-margin landing would make the booster a strong candidate for reuse, like its older sibling 1021, which launched CRS-8 in April of last year.  ### Launch Complex 39A - What's the big deal?  LC-39A is the most historically significant orbital launch pad in the United States. Its first launch was Apollo 4 in 1967, and it went on to launch the rest of the Apollo missions, with the exceptions of Apollo 7 &amp; 10. After the Saturn V and all its variants were retired, the pad was reconfigured for the Space Shuttle. Over the course of the program, it launched 82 of the 135 STS missions, including all five orbiters. Since the retirement of the Shuttle in 2011, it was sitting dormant until SpaceX began leasing it in 2014. Construction work began in earnest in 2015 and continued until early 2017, culminating in the successful static fire for this mission.  ### Useful Resources, Data, ♫, &amp; FAQ  * [Mission Patch](http://i.imgur.com/umshot6.png), courtesy SpaceX  * [Mission Patch](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/SpaceX_CRS-10_Patch.png), courtesy NASA * [Official CRS-10 Press Kit](http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/crs10presskitfinal.pdf), courtesy SpaceX * [NASA cargo overview for this mission.](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/spacex_crs-10_mission_overview.pdf) * [Hazard area map](https://goo.gl/umnY2Q), courtesy u\/raul74cz * [Reddit Stream](http://reddit-stream.com/comments/5uw4bh/), courtesy Nathan Reed * [Multi-Stream Player](http://multistream-player.com/spacex), courtesy u\/Kampar * [SpaceX Stats](http://spacexstats.xyz), courtesy of u\/EchoLogic (creation) and u\/brandtamos (rehost at .xyz) * [SpaceX FM](http://www.spacexfm.com/), courtesy u\/Iru * [Rocket Watch](http://rocketwatch.yasiu.pl/?id=778), courtesy u\/MarcysVonEylau * [Live Mission Visualisation on Flight Club](https://www.flightclub.io/world/?code=CR10&amp;w=1), courtesy u\/TheVehicleDestroyer * [Dragon on Gunter’s Space Page](http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/dragon.htm) * [CRS-10 Campaign Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/5n2eqx/spacex_crs10_launch_campaign_thread/), courtesy r\/SpaceX * [7-Day KSC weather forecast](http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=28.52255627100044&amp;lon=-80.68187902299968), courtesy Weather.gov * [Hourly KSC weather forecast](http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=28.6177&amp;lon=-80.7131&amp;unit=0&amp;lg=english&amp;FcstType=graphical), courtesy Weather.gov * [Acronym Bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/5uor5r/z/ddvooa1), courtesy u\/OrangeredStilton * [SpaceXNow](https://spacexnow.com/), courtesy u\/bradleyjh   ### Participate in the discussion!  * First of all, launch threads are party threads!

Ok""",50049,26312,2215,Spacex and friends.,"So I had this funny experience about a year ago or so, and I've been wanting to share it for a while. So, as a back story, I've always been a massive space-technology enthusiast since I was young.   I'd stay up to watch shuttle launches, see the ISS. I saw many cancelled launches and, being Irish this meant a waste of a late nighter. I learnt about Spacex through Scott Manley and quickly became a super-fan and have watched them grow for 4 years.  So my friends usually like hearing a little bit about space, but sometimes they don't find it so interesting - especially one of my best friends. So one day, we took some LSD at her apartment and I threw up an ISS live feed of earth. The acid made her all child like and full of wonder and she started asking questions about the video feed on the flatscreen.  I started explaining the ISS and the shuttle and spacex, she couldn't get enough of it. I showed her Sunita Williams ISS tour - this bit always makes my heart drop -&gt; https://youtu.be/doN4t5NKW-k?t=713  Anyway, the trip is coming to an end and I remember that SpaceX are attempting their first landing attempt with Orbcomm OG2 **THAT NIGHT.**  Unbeknownst to her she was about to witness one of the coolest events in space history. Everything went perfect. Excitement everywhere.  I couldn't believe how lucky she was to not get her dreams dashed when the fuckin thing gets scrubbed. Off without a hitch...   Thanks for reading  TL;DR: LSD and spacex gave friend spiritual time",0.0,8.0,[]

And this leads me to wonder if this potential window of opportunity could be one of the pieces of the puzzle that lead Musk to recently announce the lunar flyby mission, offering NASA first dibs on seats. Clearly, completion of this mission would dispel any questions about the viability of the Dragon 2 PICA heat shield for lunar return.  Although the ITS sounds like a pragmatic, lower cost solution for deep space access, it is realistically a decade or more away, taking into account the track record of SpaceX.  And Musk's recent NASA budget tweet doesn't suggest that he has any secret ITS funding deal with the Trump admin.  https://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-is-not-so-thrilled-with-nasas-biggest-budget-ever/  So with commercial cargo and crew services to the ISS (for as long as it remains) and perhaps also to this NASA Deep Space Gateway, it looks like SpaceX is working to establish a record as a trusted space transport provider for NASA as a hopeful stepping stone for future ITS services.",173.0,152.0,[]

That's 1,290 100 KWh batteries. Or 1,720 75 KWh batteries. Tesla is producing S and X at a combined rate of about ~1800-1900 a week.  To me this is the key. People are fighting and debating to do a stationary storage system that is tiny relative to what Tesla is producing in terms EV batteries. And its also why for Tesla producing that much storage capacity in under 100 days is less of a concern.  Now eventually, stationary storage demand could outstrip EV battery demand but for now its clear that EV's are pulling along the market.

We know FH is a beast and SpaceX claims it can take 16.8 metric tons to Mars.  So, with such a light payload, do you think there would be enough delta-v in the second stage to:   * 1) Perform an entry burn, slowing down in the Martian atmosphere. Then  * 2) Land vertically on Mars (assuming the second stage would have its own landing legs + grid fins) and deploy the rover. Then let's say the rover somehow manages to climb/get back up top on the second stage. Then  * 3) Liftoff, escape Mars' atmosphere. Then  * 4) Make it to orbit and, finally...  * 5) Perform a Trans-Earth Injection burn.   Now, as I write this, I see there are a lot of ifs and assumptions here. Like, how the heck, would they recover the returning rover, the obvious problem with the fairings and how would the rover get down from and back up to the second stage.  But still, theoretically, would the Falcon Heavy have enough delta-v for something like this?  EDIT: Formatting. ",20.0,3.0,[]

The seperartion velocities are very simular but the horizontal velocity of the FH boosters' was **500 m/s** greater than ZUMA's first stage. So the boostback burn probably wasted much more fuel. In addition to that the boosters didn't go as high as ZUMA's first stage so they had less time to return to the Landing Zones. That means that the boostback burn had to accelerate them to even higher velocities and waste more propelent   # Data ##JSON Object * [Raw data](https://github.com/shahar603/Telemetry-Data/blob/master/Falcon-Heavy/FalconHeavyRaw.json) * [Interpolated data](https://github.com/shahar603/Telemetry-Data/blob/master/Falcon-Heavy/FalconHeavy.json)  ## JSON * [Raw data](https://github.com/shahar603/Telemetry-Data/blob/master/Falcon-Heavy/FH%20raw.json) * [Interpolated data](https://github.com/shahar603/Telemetry-Data/blob/master/Falcon-Heavy/FH.json)  ## Excel * [Raw data](https://github.com/shahar603/Telemetry-Data/blob/master/Falcon-Heavy/FalHevRaw.xlsx) * [Interpolated data](https://github.com/shahar603/Telemetry-Data/blob/master/Falcon-Heavy/FalHev.xlsx)       I hope this data is useful to some of you!         ^* The abrupt stop at the end of the graph is a mistake created by the interpolation function  ^** Bright Red = 3 Boosters; Dark Red = 1 Booster; Blue = Stage 2   Edit: Added proper JSON and Excel files.

Will spend 5 hours getting zapped in Van Allen belts &amp; then attempt final burn for Mars.""",96604,12876,2740,My Estimate: Cherry-Red Paint on Starman's Tesla should last 8 to 12 years in space! (Back-of-the-napkin calculations),"As far as Earth-cars go, they are lucky!   They get REST and reprieve from the onslaught of UV sun-light, due to:   A) Night time.  B) When parked in shade.   C) Earth's atmosphere (ozone layer).   However, the Starman-Tesla, now soaring through space, is essentially going to be in 24 HOUR constant sunshine!   So that means, at the very least, we can roughly say that the fading of paint will occur TWICE as fast in space, due to roughly twice the total amount of exposure time to the sun (per day).   --------------------------------  2) BUT... exposure time is not the only enemy.   Another enemy that we must also consider is: INTENSITY of UV light.   I did a fast-google search, and one science website claims that the Ozone Layer absorbs:  99% of UVC,   90% of UVB,   50% of UVA.   NOTE: Just to keep things simple, I'll assume the sun puts out roughly equal amounts of each UV wavelength. (Not sure?)   --------------------------------  SO... next... let us go ahead and make up a fake unit of UV light called:   Paint-Damage-Units (PDU).  And let us ask: how many PDU's per second hit Starman's Tesla, versus how many PDU's per second hit the Earth car? We can solve that with this quick chart:   - 100 PDU's of UVA in space = 50% less on Earth = 50 PDU  - 100 PDU's of UVB in space = 90% less on Earth = 10 PDU  - 100 PDU's of UVC in space = 99% less on Earth = 1 PDU.   --------------------------------  THUS, in the chart above we can see that:   for every 300 PDU's that hit Starman's car,   61 PDU's strike the Earth car.   That means Starman's car is getting slammed with 4.9 times more UV-light PDU's!   --------------------------------  BUT... wait!... There is a PROBLEM with the INTENSITY calculation...   Starman's Tesla will be orbiting the sun, on average, far further out than Earth, which means less sunlight. It will be orbiting in a range that spans between Earth, Mars, and Ceres.   Since Mars is kinda in the center of that region-span... then for simplicity sake, we can use Mar's sunlight levels, as the average.   We know that Mars receives one quarter (25%) of normal Earth sunshine.   So the car will now only experience 25% of the original 300 PDU's, on average, which is: 75 PDU's.   THUS:   while 75 PDU's hit Starman's car at this second,  61 PDU's strike the Earth car.   That means Starman's car is getting slammed with 1.23 times more UV-light PDU's! (That's almost Earth-surface levels!)  ------------------------  Ok then...   So how long will Starman's Tesla's Cherry Red Paint Job last?   Well, as a final step, we need to know how long paint normally lasts under normal Earth sunshine.   I checked a few automotive websites, and they had varying estimates of how long paint color lasts, such as: 7 years, 10 years, 20 years (if you wax it!).   I've had my current car for about 10 years now, and rarely waxed it, and most of the paint still has its original color.   So... to take a wild guess... we could say Earth car-paint lasts 20 years, before very noticeable/significant fading has occurred? If we want to be really generous we could say 30 years, until more severe car-paint color fading?   But let's go with 20 years.   --------------------------------  THUS... in CONCLUSION: we can now say:   - The 20 year paint job will only last 10 years in space, due to the fact that Starman's car gets twice the amount of sun (twice the DURATION of exposure).    - Next, out of those remaining 10 years, it will last a further 1.23 times less in space, due to increased UV rays in outer space, which brings us down to a paint-lifetime of 8 years!   --------------------------------  ALL OF THIS means, based on this quick back of the napkin calculation, that:   - The paint should last a good 8 years!   - (While the same paint would last 20 years on Earth).  - So... at the average heliocentric orbital range of the Starman's Tesla, paint fades 2.5 times faster.   - Also: if we go back to being generous and assume Earth-cars can last 30 years with their paint, then that means Starman's Tesla's paint will last 12 years in space!  --------------------------------  NOTE:   Cosmic rays and microscopic dust will also wear the paint away.   BUT... I don't know the chemistry of cosmic rays hitting paint, in the vacuum of space.   So I went ahead and assumed that given only a short 8 year time frame, the most significant damage during those 8 years will be mostly likely caused by UV light from the very ""nearby"" burning star (the sun), as opposed to cosmic rays.  Also, as for microscopic dust... our space probes seem to do just fine zipping around the solar system at insane speeds. (I mean look at the Voyager probes!)   So, again... for only an 8 year time span, I assumed very little damage due to microscopic dust, as compared to the UV light streaming from the nearby sun.  --------------------------------  EDIT: I'm hoping others will come up with better estimates, and I wouldn't be surprised if I made an error somewhere (I'm no scientist!)   But it was fun to try this back of the napkin one, and see if someone has a better estimate than I could cough up!   --------------------------------  EDIT AGAIN:   Some people linked to interesting articles below, and it appears I might not have fully understood the nature of UV light in the vacuum of space.   Also I just realized that I didn't take into account thermal effects... What would be the average temperature of the surface of the car as it is out in the Mars/Ceres region?   Another effect I just realized that I didn't consider is:   high velocity particles streaming from the sun (as well as solar flares). The Tesla is going to get blasted by at least a few larger solar flares in it's long journey!   Although... again... we have a lot of probes and craft that are really old out there... and they seem to be holding up fine (again: such as the voyager space craft: those things have been facing off against streaming sun particles for decades now!). So... ",9.0,24.0,[]

People speculating on Buffet investing in the company, while not entirely impossible, the chances are close to 0. Heck, i think Amazon has a higher chance investing in Tesla than Berkshire does lol, even though it seems like Elon doesn\'t really get along with Bezos. The probability for either events to happen is just super low. If it does happen, the short squeeze will get real like Elon predicted.  I personally think he should just shut up on this matter. Spouting these stuffs on twitter over the last couple days just show me how much pain he is going through.

And there are few land areas within close range of most major cities that aren't heavily populated.  The US government won't even allow the most reliable rocket in history to launch over populated areas.  Rockets like ULA's Atlas V, which has never experienced a near-Earth failure, yet would be entirely unlikely to be permitted a launch over even thinly populated areas.  Part of that is clearly the risk of expended first stages falling over land, but not all.  An Atlas from Vandenberg could have its stage fall in the nearby test range.    SpaceX's life would be so much easier if rockets were permitted to take of eastward from Vandenberg, landing first stages on a land based target.  Yet SpaceX seems to never even attempted to seek approval for this far more efficient Eastern launch profile.  Restricting all landing and takeoff profiles to over water would be extremely limiting to the prospects of BFR Air, just as they were to Concorde.  This aside from the many regulatory hurdles facing BFR Air,  not the least of which is ITAR.  Perhaps that's why a tunnel 50 to 100 miles off shore is the plan.  A very expensive plan.  A plan that would add significant costs to every BFR ticket.  If anything, the reveal of this plan diminishes further the prospects that BFR Air will soon or ever launch paying customers.  Perhaps it sends up a few Kármán line tourists, but city-to-city travel presents almost insurmountable hurdles, at least within the first decade or two of BFR flights.  TLDR - It's difficult to see BFR Air surpassing the commercial, political, or [NIMBY]( hurdles.

You strap into your hyperloop pod at a terminus, it's a sealed pod with it's own life support (operates in a vacuum tube afterall) and seating to protect passengers through high acceleration and emergency braking. It's effectively a rocket capsule.  So why if you are already in a rocket capsule, would you hop out of one, walk across a bridge to some big rocket, sit down in another chair and strap in? Then do it again on landing to transfer to another pod?  Loading aircraft with people on foot takes a long time, 30 minutes easily. With point-to-point rocket transit the time to load and unload the passengers on foot will be longer than the flight.   Now if instead your passenger loading just involves a large robotic arm gently slotting hyperloop pods into a giant wine rack in the BFR cargo bay, then loading/unloading could be done in like 10 minutes. Slot the pods into the rack (aligned so the crash couches of the pods are aligned for launch/landing. Close the doors and go.   When you land, the pods can be unloaded and placed straight into a hyperloop tube at the service tower, whisked away off towards the city. People could be hopping out of the first pod in the city before the last pod is even unloaded.   Passenger management is a huge engineering problem for airlines. Loading and Unloading passengers, and managing passengers in airports with traffic flows and security is a major cost in air travel. If you eliminate foot traffic passengers entirely on the launch site, integrate the airport mass transit with regional mass transit, and have all the security handled at the hyperloop terminals, then you have basically eliminated 90% of the cost issues of airports.    What's more this logistics system could easily include cargo. A cargo hyperloop pod could be loaded in one city, whisked to launch port, loaded and it's being unloaded in another city in under an hour.   There is already a huge market for international flights of high value perishable goods, imagine if someone catches a big Tuna off the coast of New Zealand. A bidding war online occurs as soon as it's landed on the boat. Boat returns to port and the fish is loaded on pod. Within an hour, that fish is being unloaded from a pod in downtown Tokyo's elite restaurant district.

Steel in general has a radiation halving thickness of 2.5cm(1in), water is 18cm(7in) for comparison, halving from an extremely dangerous level can still be a dangerous level but thickening the shielding above and below the berthings(Cabins) with a thicker shield as well as around the outer hull surrounding the berthing area could turn the berthings themselves into the storm shelter. For a Solar Particle Event I would also add a steel hatch above and below the compartments as well as steel covers you can close over the individual portholes (Windows).  As you look at the design the shielding below the berthing area could be thinner since it has steel hull below it, but with the large windows in the upper compartment you would need thicker shielding at the top of the berthing compartment.

This is an actual picture, not a rendering.""",118295,20890,4470,Questions about applying for a fabrication job at SpaceX.,"(throwaway account for reasons that will become obvious)  So I'm a welder by trade, I trained I was TIG and worked for over a year exclusively on 3xx stainless, not aerospace, but it's experience.  Since the announcements about starship and the boilerplate being built, combined with a holiday trip to Kenedy space center, has me craving a change of pace.  I see SpaceX has several open welding positions available actually, but I have some questions about the company before I try to apply.  Firstly (and the reason for the throwaway), I live in a legal marijuana state and my current job does not care about personal use, so I smoke a little to help my social anxiety. Does spacex drug test? I've tried Google, but the company is so big that is seems like some positions test and others don't? I was getting mixed signals. I have no problem with quitting, but I also know I'm probably going to be ""dirty"" for 6 months and I would rather not wait to submit my resume.  Second, what's the pay scale and advancement opportunities like? I saw some rough figures on pay, and while I don't mind starting near the bottom end of the pay scale, I definitely want to move up as I gain experience. Are they good about this? (giving timely reviews and decent raises). Do they pay overtime? I see people complain about long hours, but are they working 7/12's or something more like 5/12's or 6/10's? I'm used to working 50+ hour weeks already   I'm obviously from outside CA, so what is rent like? I looked directly in Hawthorne and it's around $1200-1500 for about 650 sqft 1bd. Is that reasonable or are there better areas to look? Do they help with relocation or housing costs? How much are other living expenses like food compared to elsewhere? I'm trying to figure out a budget for my expenses to know the lowest hourly rate I can actually afford, but it's kind of hard from out of state to figure out all that stuff   And lastly, how long does it usually take to hear from them (if you're going to). Is this one of those companies that seem to review applications the day before they expire or are they pretty proactive about it?  Sorry for such a long post, but I never really looked into working there before going to KSC and seeing actual space hardware up close and realizing that I have the skills to actually work on that kind of hardware. Space has always seemed like something magical, not something where you grind out your 60 hours and go home. That's what I do now... I love space to the point where I'm willing to uproot and practically start a new life to have to opportunity to work on that kind of hardware.  Tldr: Does spacex drug test, how do they pay, what are ""long hours"", what are living expenses actually like in CA. ",7.0,5.0,[]

We created Tesla to accelerate a sustainable future &amp; it’s happening!""",31937,3396,948,"My Model 3 LR RWD needed a new Brake Booster. Pretty good experience with Tesla Call Center, Service Center and Online Chat!","Got into my car one morning when it was about 35F outside, pushed the brake and move the stalk down to drive.  I noticed the car creeping forward (I have creep off) until I realized I was just slowly rolling down my driveway.  An orange ""brakes"" warning indicator was lit up on the display.  I pushed harder on the brakes, and the pedal started to vibrate as if the ABS was working, but the pedal was only traveling 20% of its normal range.  I DID have brakes, but just no power assistance.   I drove my short commute to work without a problem, just being extra safe.  Once I arrived I called Tesla's support number to explain what happened.  I was really pleased to be speaking with someone after only a 10 minute wait, the same person that took my call was also able to remotely connect to the car and check it out.  She saw a warning that regenerative braking was disabled and saw the ""brakes"" warning light.  She offered to have it towed to service if I didn't feel safe, but I said I could drive it.  When I mentioned they probably won't have an appointment for a month, she said ""No worries, I'll reach out to them to let them know you'll be on your way to see them in a couple hours.""  When got to the service center, I expected them to take my key and give me a loaner since I knew they were so busy.  Turns out, they had a tech check out the car within ~15 minutes of my arrival.  He said it was likely the brake booster, a part they didn't have in stock because it's not a common repair.  They gave me a new Model S 75D with 300 miles on the odometer as a loaner and sent me on my way.  The next day I got a text that they confirmed it's the brake booster and they've ordered the part.  I was very pessimistic, expecting THIS to be the bottleneck to get my car back.  Sure enough, the next day I got another text from the SC saying they received the part but there were a few cars ahead of mine for the shop.  The next day I got another text saying it's still queued for the shop.  Then, on the morning of the next day, around 9am, I got a text that they've started working on it and expect to have it ready by the afternoon.  Sure enough, around 11:30AM, received a text that the car was ready to be picked up!  Less than a week after I dropped it off!  As a bonus, they charged me up to 80% and updated me to 50.6.  This is from a service center in a major metro area.  I did not have a day go by when I didn't receive at least 1 text update, and they always responded to my replies within an hour or two.     When I started driving my 3, I noticed a lot of brake pedal travel, I wasn't sure if the pedal should feel stiffer.  It was as if there may have been air in the lines.  I went to Tesla.com and started a support chat session, I had someone in the chat in about 10 minutes.  After mentioning the repair I just had done, I asked if it was possible for them to remote into the car as maybe % brake pedal travel is something they could see in the logs to see if it's abnormal.  Maybe there was air in the lines.  She said she wasn't able to check that, but asked if I'd like to speak with the tech.  I said ""a tech"" or ""my tech""?  She said she could have him call me.  I'm thinking, yea sure, the tesla.com chat agent is going to have the ability to locate my tech and have him call me.  Sure enough, 10 min later my cell phone rings and I'm speaking to the man that was actually working on my car!  He said that since changing the booster really opens up the brake system so they were overzealous with the bleeding procedure.  He also confirmed the car was test driven a lot after the repair (invoice showed 6 mile difference between in/out odometer), which seems like plenty to me.  Finally, he offered to take a look at it again if I brought it in.  I told him I have a friend with a Model 3 and I'll just check his brake pedal to see if it feels the same.  When I checked, it did.  :-)  Here are the details from the invoice:  https://i.imgur.com/SIfjs7x.jpg  EDIT:  VIN ~20,000",12.0,63.0,[]

[which increases payload capability - necessary for Mars operations]  On the face of it, this seems a shift in focus from Mars which has always been SpaceX’s prime objective.  This sudden shift in strategy can probably be ascribed to many good and practical reasons: -  **Lunar Resources**  There is maybe a billion of tonnes or more of volatile materials (frozen water, carbon dioxide, methane etc) on or near the surface, in [lunar polar craters](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/21oct_lcross2). These should be of tremendous value in the future because it is far easier to launch anything from the moon than Earth (2.74 km/s delta-v compared to 9.3 km/s to reach LEO respectively). Whoever reaches these craters first will have first claim to these resources. No wonder Blue Origin plan to land at the lunar south pole in 2024 with their [Blue Moon project]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_Blue_Moon). As an added incentive SpaceX could use these resources to refuel Mars-bound vehicles in LEO, reducing the number of tanker launches required and problems with propellant boil off.  **Proving Mars Technology**  Anything and everything SpaceX will need for Mars can be proved first using the moon. All such equipment can be classed as vital (i.e. can’t fail on Mars for a successful mission) and should include: -  * Reusable Starship spacecraft – propulsive landing needs to be demonstrated in low gravity/vacuum, plus closed loop ecosystem to generate new air and food  * Reusable Superheavy booster – vital to launch Starship and tanker spacecraft for the necessary on orbit refuelling to reach Moon   * In Situ Resource Utilisation machinery – used to extract carbon dioxide and water from the environment and convert to methalox propellant  * Power generation – combination of solar array and nuclear e.g. [kilopower]( https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/kilopower)  **Funding**  SpaceX already receive partial funding from Yusaku Maezawa for his [#dearMoon]( https://dearmoon.earth/) flight around the moon, so need to demonstrate progress towards such capability. However, if SpaceX can demonstrate moon landing with a vehicle as capable as Starship, funding will likely follow from NASA, ESA and many others who wish to visit the moon, or even establish a long term settlement such as [Moon Village]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_the_Moon#Moon_Village). Fortunately such funding shouldn’t be seen to compete with NASA’s SLS program, which is required to build and operate a space station (LOP-G) in cislunar space.  **Politics**  China are currently operating a [lunar rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang'e_4), which can be seen as a precursor to human landings around 2030. Hence the US will be high motivated to put their own people on the moon before then, if only for political reasons. This too should work in SpaceX’s favour, political support and permissions for Starship operation would be expedited, removing many potential political roadblocks.  **Conclusion**  The moon should be a lot easier to reach than Mars and provide SpaceX with funding, political support, a proving ground and many future benefits, like a fuel station on the way to Mars.

The first one told me I would not be refunded the difference and the price is the price. The second one (who was much nicer and I think actually tried to understand what I was saying) state that they did not have any answers yet mostly since it was the weekend and many of the managers are not there.

Isn’t this a breach of contract?","I placed my down payment October 2018. I took delivery of my model 3 in November 2018. I was told the trade-in center was over the holiday was super busy and to take delivery and they would contact me when they could. I signed all the loan documents when I took delivery.   I started calling the bank to see when and how to make my first payment. The loan was approved through Tesla with Wells Fargo. I accepted the loan through email. Wells Fargo told me they had not received the loan yet and to call back in a week or two and that it takes time. Multiple calls throughout December no answers from bank or Tesla.   January I receive an email saying they are finalizing the loan and but need more information in the documents listed (the email is blank no attachments). I email them back let them know nothing is in the email, I call the Vm box is full. I continue calling Tesla and the bank throughout January and February no response/Vm box is full.   March comes, I receive an email saying I owe $43,700.00 or the car will be repossessed. I call and email immediately explaining I received a loan through Tesla with Wells Fargo, I’ve been trying to pay it since I took delivery. They inform me the woman no longer worked there and she never turned it in. The gentlemen I was working with in terms of trade-in no longer worked there as well. They ask if I am still interested in trading in my car towards the loan and they have confirmation that they can still proceed with the trade-in, I accept.   I continue emailing with the new rep assigned to this, I continue to reiterate that we need to get the ball rolling. My husband has a job transfer and we are moving. She informs me it would be wise to payoff the lien on the trade in to expedite the loan. I pay the car off in order to get the loan going.   I was called yesterday after I emailed every single person I have ever been in contact with at Tesla giving a timeline of events, quotes from emails, etc. And told, I will have to reapply for the loan. Forfeit my $7500.00 tax credit because I’ll be “taking delivery in 2019.” Lose my deposit and put down a new deposit. Pay for new tag and title/registration and pay the new taxes for the new state I moved to or they will not honor the trade-in.   I’ve had the car for 6 months. I did everything by the book. I’m not the one who didn’t bother to turn in my loan documents. I am not the one who didn’t handle the trade-in correctly. Why am I being punished for their negligence? Isn’t this a breach of contract? I have documentation and proof of everything that has happened along the way.  Side note, it cost me $4550 to ship my Tesla to Hawaii. And, the payments on the trade-in the entire time, plus insurance, exceed me giving the car back in the old state I lived in and just buying a new one in Hawaii.   Tl;dr Tesla never turned in my loan documents from November 2018 and wants me to forfeit my $7500 tax credit, down payment and pay for new tag, title, and registration.",208.0,93.0,[]

Sure vertical integration has been a long standing strategy of Tesla. And Elons comment about getting into the mining business to secure raw materials falls into this category as well.  So of course some, including me, have long suspected, that Tesla will eventually produce their own batteries instead of relying on Panasonic or others.  With the acquisition of Maxwell Technologies, Tesla now owns the knowledge for a production process itself, i.e. how to produce dry-electrode LI batteries. Also, per Maxwells claims of a 16-fold reduced production space requirement, Tesla could certainly find a place to do so.  &amp;#x200B;  But so far, this has all been speculation.  However, Elons, JBs and Drews comments at the Shareholders Meeting at around 1:11:10 gave me the strong impression, that this scenario will play out very soon.  (Paraphrasing here)  **Elon:** Don't want to let the cat out of the bag too much \[major news obvsly\]  **JB:** Exactly the right problems to solve - to scale. It has been for some time but its more obvious now \[cause Panasonic can't keep up?\].  **JB:** We need a large scale solution to solve production. \[large scale as in utilizing a fuckton of money to build their own battery production?\]  **Elon:** and get costs per kilowatt hour lower \[because Panasonic is adding its profit margin and thus increases costs/kwh\]  **Elon:** and energy density higher \[requiring some major innovation, e.g. a new tech from a recently acquired company?\]  **Drew:** We ain't sitting idly by, we're taking all the moves required to be **masters of our own destiny technologically and otherwise** \[hello hint hint??\]  **Drew:** trough all the experience we have developed with our partners and otherwise \[it's known that Tesla and Maxwell worked together for over a year prior to acquisition\]  **Drew:** we have solutions in place \[is that so\]  **Elon:** laughs as if he knows something when Maxwell is mentioned \[classic Elon giveaway\]  **Elon:** Maxwell is quite **strategic** \[as in will change the big picture -&gt; could mean integration battery production\]  &amp;#x200B;  When I heard this, I just had to think that they were trying hard to not announce internal battery production.",99.0,201.0,[]

This is a follow up to a [short story I wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/a5bzq0/ordinary_space_person_accidentally_stows_away_on/) about the Ordinary Space Person riding the CRS-16 core down to its watery landing.   I am especially interested in any feedback on the reality / physics side of things, because despite it being a totally ridiculous scenario, I want to be as accurate as possible with the details!  &amp;nbsp;   **Accidental Astronaut 2.0**  &amp;nbsp;  Reluctantly forced awake by a jab to his arm, Jim felt a growing but familiar sense of dread.   The suit was back.   The sultry, yet impeccably professional voice spoke. *“Consciousness is advised for launch. Please prepare yourself. Liftoff in 10, 9, 8...”*  Quickly rolling over and spreading out on the angled metal beneath him, Jim tried to remember the previous day, but drew a blank. Before he had a chance to wonder how the hell this happened a second time, the engines ignited and the weight piled on. Helmet forced to one side by the launch g-forces, Jim stared at the rectangular grey panels filling his field of view, and realisation slowly dawned. He was *in* a SpaceR fairing.   Screaming a little inside the suit, Jim regretted most of his life choices up until this point. Eventually the g-forces eased, and scientific curiosity won out against fear. “Ahhh, throttling back for max-q” he muttered, enjoying the slight reprieve before being once again flattened as the engines ramped back to full power. Struggling to remain conscious, he groggily wondered if SpaceR was planning to recover the fairings on this launch.    Soon the acceleration backed off again and Jim could sit up a little. “Hello MECO, old friend” he slurred to no-one in particular. He fumbling for a handhold, hoping to avoid being body slammed by the rocket when the second stage engine ignited. But after a quick shudder, the acceleration ramped back up. Jim felt another jab in his arm, and clarity returned a little. “Ahah,” he said, “Falcon Heavy. That was actually the side booster separation.” He wished he was riding one back to Earth, rather than heading to orbit on the second stage.   As the acceleration eased for the real MECO, Jim pondered the rather ridiculous situation he had once again found himself in. There was no way he was getting a rescue from orbit, so the only way back to Earth was on a fairing. “Hah, easy.” he said, sarcasm beating out terror. As the acceleration subsided, Jim wedged his feet against the payload adapter and stood up. He managed to work his gloved hands under some piping on the closest fairing half, hoping desperately it was equipped with parachutes. As the second stage engine ignited, he felt the suit legs stiffen to help him remain standing, but the g-forces were nowhere near as severe as launch.   The rapid jolt of the fairing separation almost broke Jim’s grip, and left his feet swinging wildly out into space. He caught a glimpse of the second stage powering on before the suits visor dimmed, protecting his eyes from the glare of the otherwise harmless engine exhaust wash. The fairing orientated itself for re-entry with burst from cold gas thrusters, and Jim felt a tiny bit of weight return as they started to decelerate in the thin upper atmosphere.   “I am really getting sick of this shit”, Jim muttered, as he slowly inched forward on the fairing, feeling like the middle was a much less scary place to be. “And I really wish I had asked how many G’s the fairings experience on re-entry.” As tempting as it was to lay face down and pretend everything was ok, Jim flipped himself over and lay on his back, hands wedged under some cabling, ready for anything.   The gentle pressure from behind increased as the fairing fell deeper into the atmosphere, and Jim marveled as a pale blue glow started to build. It bloomed brighter, with streams of twisting, shimmering plasma wrapping around the fairing and merging together in a spectacular light show. The astonishing view was punctuated by sparkling showers of light as bigger particles ignited. As he watched, Jim felt a growing sense of calm that quieted even those pesky thoughts concerned about plummeting to his death from the edge of space. Mesmerised, he idly wondered if the light show was created by pseudoadiamatic compression heating, or if there was some sort of more exotic hypersonic friction at play. Either way it looked incredible, and he made a mental note to [ask](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/c8unpk/stp2_fairing_reentry_spacex_tweet/esq0wam/) his friend /u/CAM-Gerlach about it later.   All too soon the effects waned as the fairing hit thicker atmosphere and slowed, leaving with his hands clenched tight around the cables, wondering what was next. The thump of the parachute deploying was rather muted, but a huge relief, and he watched the canopy spread out above. With normal gravity back in play, Jim rustled up some bravery and crawled over to the rear of the fairing and peeked over. He thought he could make out some light very far below, but mostly it was just pitch black. To avoid upsetting the balance of the fairing, he moved back to the middle and curled up as best he could. The parachute obscured a big chunk of the sky, but he could still make out some familiar constellations, twinkling enigmatically as if they were in on some grand practical joke.    As the fairing slowly glided down to Earth, the adrenaline wore off and Jim relaxed. The suit admistered a different injection, and remarkably the gently rocking of the fairing lulled him to sleep. He didn’t even feel the slight bump as they touched down safely in Ms Tree’s net. The suit spoke softly once more.   &amp;nbsp;   *“Mission success.”*   &amp;nbsp;  ...  &amp;nbsp;  Jim woke up in his hotel bed, and was reaching for his phone before the memories of the unexpected trip into space came flooding back. He frantically felt himself all over, but he wasn’t wearing the spacesuit anymore. His arm still stung a little from the repeated shots the suit had administered, and he felt bruised all over.   “I need to stop drinking with engineers” he said, wondering what the fuck actually happened last night.    &amp;nbsp;  Back at the SpaceR headquarters, an engineer spoke to the suit as he downloaded the video logs. “Welcome home. Maybe now we will find out why you are so intent on getting into space.”  &amp;nbsp;",11.0,18.0,[]

They are not starting with 100 years of experience making ICE drive trains.   Yet Tesla has made the safest cars ever and they don't pollute and are much fun to drive.   Now traditional ICE manufacturers produce ICE lemons by the dozen and they have no experience at all with EV's.   Now Tesla has a multi year jump on the competition so if you go for an ICE manufacturers first EV you will need luck to avoid getting a lemon and get little support since the 20% extra you will pay at the dealership to cover sales and advertising won't have gotten you little if any trained EV service technicians.   Tesla even with blemishes is the only sensible choice and if it is frustrating as they work through their exponential demand curve all other choices will have worse outcomes.   Tesla saves you the 20% overhead a dealership brings with it plus the Tesla is superior to any car on a dealership lot.",1.0,12.0,[]

Scientists then were surprised to find that these magnetic fields were nearly as strong, and as protective against ionized radiation, as is the Earth's global field. This finding is so important in terms of where to build a habitat and expand it into a colony that's it's hard to imagine SpaceX not working with it. It implies that a colony would only have to worry about air pressure, temperature and meteor strikes, which might require thicker protection but not as much as otherwise, and the silica aerogel solution would work on greenhouses, giving them warmth and protection from UV. But the biggest benefit of building in a localized magnetic field is that astronauts would be able to work outside without worrying about radiation. They would just have to stay away from the areas at the edges where the magnetic fields enter the ground, but the protected areas are quite large--50 km wide by up to 2,000 km long.  From the report:  ""Mars' crustal magnetic fields themselves are a mystery, because they are nearly as strong at the surface as the Earth's magnetic field - a few tenths of a Gauss, compared to a third of a Gauss on Earth. Plus they are arrayed in east-west bands of alternating polarity, extending for over 1,000 kilometers north to south like a bar code across the planet's surface. Scientists still do not know what materials produce this strong field, or why it occurs in alternating bands.  ""The magnetic field lines can be pictured as half cylinders lined up side by side on the surface, oriented east and west. The place where the half-cylinders touch are areas of strong vertical magnetic field, where ionized hydrogen and helium of the solar wind are able to funnel down to low altitudes. The tops of the cylinders are areas of strong horizontal magnetic field, which acts as an umbrella to shield the underlying atmosphere from the solar wind.  '""These crustal magnetic anomalies form cylindrical magnetic objects that shield the atmosphere much like the Earth's dipole field does the entire Earth, except on Mars it is local,"" he said. ""You can see a very interesting pattern of shielded regions and cusps where the solar wind funnels down in between.""'  If none of these areas are at low enough altitude, then possibly the first Starships would have to land somewhere else where the air is denser. And also possibly if none shows easy access to water ice. But I expect SpaceX has analyzed them to find one with a perfect fit. I just haven't heard any rumors of it. Has anyone else?

They now think these long magnetic strips were formed by early tectonic plate movement, which forms similar strips in Earth''s crust.

I test drove a Model 3, and while I loved the way it drove, the lack of a gauge cluster was more significant than I originally thought, and the interior room was lacking a little for my own needs. That’s what solidified my decision in getting a Tesla though, the Chevrolet just couldn’t compare.   So I have a quick question for you MS owners who have the air suspension. I’ve read a lot about longevity and there doesn’t seem to be major concerns there, and seeing as I’m currently at 60,000 miles I don’t think I have much to worry about.

I'm imagining them attached up near the top so that the plume spreads out enough that debris wont be kicked up hard enough to cause damage.  I don't know enough about pressure-fed engines to say whether you could attach a feasible number to Starship to actually land starship.  edit: maybe I should explain a bit more of my thinking.  starship dry mass: 260,000lbs.superdraco thrust 16,000 lbf (assuming a starship hot gas thruster has the same thrust)moon gravity: 1/6th260,000/(6\*16000) = 2.7... so, 3 super dracos could lift an empty starship off the moon. now, how much fuel do you need to get from moon surface to low moon orbit (where you can refuel)?

Like Dragonglass, but solar!""",56412,2562,1659,Thoughts on the Solar(Glass) Roof &amp; Why Tesla Will Become A Global Energy Utility,"I wanted to take a minute to outline my thoughts of yesterday's announcement and the overall forward-looking guidance for the Solar Roof in 2020 (and beyond). But before I do, I just want to highlight something Elon said during the earning's call on Wednesday when discussing their new solar rental business:   ""...And it sort of plays into Tesla's overarching strategy here which is effectively to become a giant distributed global utility..."".   I don't think this statement was discussed once in any of the analyst calls or articles that were written following the Q3 call. I also don't think most investors or fans that follow the company understand what this means or the disruption that is happening right now within the energy markets and why existing energy utilities are fighting back, making it very difficult or impossible for you and your family to install solar and storage products in certain areas of the U.S. I'll digress here and share this link to an article written in 2017 that I think perfectly sums up what is going on and how Tesla is well-positioned to take advantage of the market transformation: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/7/7/15927250/utilities-rooftop-solar-batteries   The statement that Elon made implies Tesla Energy may have a bigger impact on the company's long-term success than automotive. I generally think this will be true. If you put aside the value proposition of autonomous vehicles and a resulting ride sharing network, it's very hard to justify Tesla's current market cap or future market cap based on the growth of auto sales. There has never been a $500 bn auto company and there likely won't ever be. There's too much competition and it's too difficult to scale to the point where you can dominate the market. Excluding Tesla, the entire market cap of the top 10 automakers in the world equals ~$400 bn. How much is the combined market cap for the top 10 energy utilities? $550 bn. I wish this topic is discussed more on this sub in the future. As an investor, I think the vehicles are great and incredibly important to the future of sustainable transport, don't get me wrong. But as an investor, I treat the Model 3 &amp; Y as mostly the ends to a mean for spurring adoption of residential, in-home solar + storage and more obviously, autonomy and the Tesla Network. Not trying to downplay the importance of vehicle sales to Tesla's bottom-line, just trying to speak to the under-appreciated importance of energy and specifically, the solar roof.  The addressable market is just bigger in the energy sector than in the auto sector. This is partly why I have long considered the solar roof to be one of the most critical products to Tesla's long-term success. This is just my opinion but I feel that their solar roof product will comprise as much and if not more than 75% of the company's solar-driven revenue in years to come and as much as 5-10% of their annual revenue by 2022. If you think this is an outlandishly crazy, I'd refer you to the California law that was passed in May of 2018 that requires all new homes under three stories high to install solar panels starting January 1, 2019. More policies like this are being implemented across the world every year that mandate solar to be integrated into new and/or existing homes. But most importantly is the fact that the no. 1 reason why most would be residential solar customers don't purchase or rent solar is because of how solar looks; Either they don't like it or their community has banned it because of how it looks. Enter the solar roof. It looks great and it's going to change people's minds about what solar can be. It's going to sell like hotcakes y'all.  Tesla will become a globally distributed energy utility by selling solar and storage products to as many grid-connected consumers as they can. Capturing the value of the energy produced over time (a roof lasts 20 years), by allowing customers to finance the purchase of their solar roof or panels by giving Tesla the rights to the energy produced, which drops the purchase price or allows for rental (see below for more on this) will be a money printing business and allow for the Tesla Energy ecosystem to enter more and more households, creating an upward spiral of success. If every home that Tesla touches becomes a micro power plant and tesla owns or can manipulate the energy produced, a distributed energy utility Tesla will be. The shift to the solar rental business supports this and the solar roof is going to be a game-changer for solar adoption.  My thoughts on the Solar(Glass) Roof: * Overall I thought the call was poorly executed. Elon was being Elon. Moving on. * Disappointed to hear that the slate and clay solar roof tiles are almost a year away from mass-production. These products are much more difficult to produce and install at scale as of right now. But it should be factored in there that most homes won't look good with the standard black tile and so # of sales won't be as juicy in 2020. Combined with the problem of scaling up production, this may make it look like the solar roof is a total failure in some eyes by the end of 2020. * Elon and co. didn't discuss financing and the new webpage doesn't include information regarding this. The old website allowed for financing quote where the cost of purchase/installation went down significantly if you agreed to let Tesla own the energy generated over time. This wasn't discussed but I think I know why. I think the early demand for the first 50-100k of these roofs is going to be very high and likely purchased en-masse by developers in California and out west. I also think that in-time Tesla will allow financing but they're not making it available early on because they are valuing cash right now more so than long-term cash flow. Hence why they will just let folks buy these roofs at an avg cost of $34k and wait until 2021 once demand starts to fall off to provide more incentive/accessibility to buy. *I hope one day that Tesla will provide a service/tool where you can submit a photo of your home and they will show virtually what it would look like with all three tile styles. Most high-end homebuilders and construction/designers offer this. You basically get a photo of your home with the new roof rendered on top of it. I fear folks are going to get excited and purchase the black tile roof or another style when available and realize after installation that they absolutely hate it and then Tesla has to come out and uninstall and replace it with another style.

But before I do, I just want to highlight something Elon said during the earning's call on Wednesday when discussing their new solar rental business:   ""...And it sort of plays into Tesla's overarching strategy here which is effectively to become a giant distributed global utility..."".   I don't think this statement was discussed once in any of the analyst calls or articles that were written following the Q3 call. I also don't think most investors or fans that follow the company understand what this means or the disruption that is happening right now within the energy markets and why existing energy utilities are fighting back, making it very difficult or impossible for you and your family to install solar and storage products in certain areas of the U.S. I'll digress here and share this link to an article written in 2017 that I think perfectly sums up what is going on and how Tesla is well-positioned to take advantage of the market transformation: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/7/7/15927250/utilities-rooftop-solar-batteries   The statement that Elon made implies Tesla Energy may have a bigger impact on the company's long-term success than automotive. I generally think this will be true. If you put aside the value proposition of autonomous vehicles and a resulting ride sharing network, it's very hard to justify Tesla's current market cap or future market cap based on the growth of auto sales. There has never been a $500 bn auto company and there likely won't ever be. There's too much competition and it's too difficult to scale to the point where you can dominate the market. Excluding Tesla, the entire market cap of the top 10 automakers in the world equals ~$400 bn. How much is the combined market cap for the top 10 energy utilities? $550 bn. I wish this topic is discussed more on this sub in the future. As an investor, I think the vehicles are great and incredibly important to the future of sustainable transport, don't get me wrong. But as an investor, I treat the Model 3 &amp; Y as mostly the ends to a mean for spurring adoption of residential, in-home solar + storage and more obviously, autonomy and the Tesla Network. Not trying to downplay the importance of vehicle sales to Tesla's bottom-line, just trying to speak to the under-appreciated importance of energy and specifically, the solar roof.  The addressable market is just bigger in the energy sector than in the auto sector. This is partly why I have long considered the solar roof to be one of the most critical products to Tesla's long-term success. This is just my opinion but I feel that their solar roof product will comprise as much and if not more than 75% of the company's solar-driven revenue in years to come and as much as 5-10% of their annual revenue by 2022. If you think this is an outlandishly crazy, I'd refer you to the California law that was passed in May of 2018 that requires all new homes under three stories high to install solar panels starting January 1, 2019. More policies like this are being implemented across the world every year that mandate solar to be integrated into new and/or existing homes. But most importantly is the fact that the no. 1 reason why most would be residential solar customers don't purchase or rent solar is because of how solar looks; Either they don't like it or their community has banned it because of how it looks. Enter the solar roof. It looks great and it's going to change people's minds about what solar can be. It's going to sell like hotcakes y'all.  Tesla will become a globally distributed energy utility by selling solar and storage products to as many grid-connected consumers as they can. Capturing the value of the energy produced over time (a roof lasts 20 years), by allowing customers to finance the purchase of their solar roof or panels by giving Tesla the rights to the energy produced, which drops the purchase price or allows for rental (see below for more on this) will be a money printing business and allow for the Tesla Energy ecosystem to enter more and more households, creating an upward spiral of success. If every home that Tesla touches becomes a micro power plant and tesla owns or can manipulate the energy produced, a distributed energy utility Tesla will be. The shift to the solar rental business supports this and the solar roof is going to be a game-changer for solar adoption.  My thoughts on the Solar(Glass) Roof: * Overall I thought the call was poorly executed. Elon was being Elon. Moving on. * Disappointed to hear that the slate and clay solar roof tiles are almost a year away from mass-production. These products are much more difficult to produce and install at scale as of right now. But it should be factored in there that most homes won't look good with the standard black tile and so # of sales won't be as juicy in 2020. Combined with the problem of scaling up production, this may make it look like the solar roof is a total failure in some eyes by the end of 2020. * Elon and co. didn't discuss financing and the new webpage doesn't include information regarding this. The old website allowed for financing quote where the cost of purchase/installation went down significantly if you agreed to let Tesla own the energy generated over time. This wasn't discussed but I think I know why. I think the early demand for the first 50-100k of these roofs is going to be very high and likely purchased en-masse by developers in California and out west. I also think that in-time Tesla will allow financing but they're not making it available early on because they are valuing cash right now more so than long-term cash flow. Hence why they will just let folks buy these roofs at an avg cost of $34k and wait until 2021 once demand starts to fall off to provide more incentive/accessibility to buy. *I hope one day that Tesla will provide a service/tool where you can submit a photo of your home and they will show virtually what it would look like with all three tile styles. Most high-end homebuilders and construction/designers offer this. You basically get a photo of your home with the new roof rendered on top of it. I fear folks are going to get excited and purchase the black tile roof or another style when available and realize after installation that they absolutely hate it and then Tesla has to come out and uninstall and replace it with another style. Maybe this won't be a big issue, but I think the cost and time of creating a tool like this that allows a homeowner to get a preview of what it may look like, is worth it to prevent servicing time from being wasted. *I assume the solar roof is compatible with the powerwall or other battery storage products but was somewhat surprised to not hear that said specifically during the call.

We had previously applied for Tesla’s solar panels (8.2kW), but got stalled because they wanted us to re-roof for an additional $8,000. The total price of the solar panel system plus re-roof was $36,000. The price of the Solar Roof is estimated at $40,000, but the tax credit is much larger and the total kW is also bigger (9.5kW), making it a no-brainer alternative.   The only caveat is that we are part of a small community HOA and the Tesla Solar Roof looks nothing like the roof tiles of the entire neighborhood. California has a law that prohibits HOA’s from denying solar installations, regardless of HOA rules. We were thinking that we could basically use this law to justify the Solar Roof, and they wouldn’t have any legal recourse to fine us or prevent the installation.   This might be more appropriate for the legaladvice subreddit, but we wanted to probe some Tesla-user thoughts on this situation, as there might be others in a similar position. Obviously we are going to talk to our HOA, but we wanted to go into talks as informed as possible.  Edit: roof tiles* not shingles. Tesla solar roof resembles flat black shingles, while our neighborhood is all curved roof tiles of varying colors (dark brown to orange).",132.0,65.0,[]

You might also be aware that Raptor engines can only throttle so low, 50% I believe, thus making hovering an issue especially at low weight, which in my opinion diminishes Starship’s outstanding capacity, just a tad (not really).   I imagine that Starships’ landings will be automated, but I expect that the capacity for limited human input (while landing) might be played around with, if SpaceX are comfortable with avionics scripts (Imagine implementing dead zones for pitch and yaw to prevent catastrophic oversteer of the rocket).   The ability for a Starship pilot to hover (wasteful) the craft while being able to dynamically and safely control the rocket over 3 axes, at low Earth altitudes will surely have some interesting applications (I would think).  Having smaller, less powerful engines (than sea-level optimized Raptors), arranged to supplement existing sea-level and vacuum engines, might enable hovering, especially if the engines are designed their lowest throttle configuration aligned with near empty Starship Earth weight (probably be too powerful on the moon or Mars of course, but that’s another issue).   Finally, combining the efficient start-stop abilities of full-flow staged combustion engines, the above described engine array and some dynamic thrust-weight scripts, taking advantage of the smallest engines, could really enhance Starships’ low altitude, human-controlled flight.",9.0,0.0,[]

When you say:  &gt;we should be more strict on lockdowns as we get closer to herd immunity  This indicates you\'re not understanding the science because locking down everyone directly *prevents* progress toward herd immunity. A new paper out yesterday shows that positive effects of herd immunity may start as low as 20% and reach full effect well before 50%.  We shouldn\'t end the lockdowns just because they disproportionately target the most vulnerable: [our poor,]( [disadvantaged]( and marginalized, we should do it because deaths are *still* going up and analysis of the data shows [lockdowns are no longer working well.](  Important new serology studies have come out in the past week from [Finland,]( [Denmark,]( [New York,]( [China,]( Italy, [Boston,]( [Santa Clara,]( [Germany,]( [Netherlands,]( Angeles,]( [Miami,]( [Denmark #2,]( and [Switzerland](  They are all directionally in agreement that CV19 is far more widespread than thought, making it much less deadly than once feared because there are a large number of previously undetected asymptomatic and mild cases missing from the denominator. These new serology results are consistent with other recent non-serology findings, including whole-population RT-PCR tests in prisons, shelters and navy ships, showing that CV19\'s contagiousness is very high (R0=[5.2]( to [6.6]( that [50%]( to [80%]( of infections are asymptomatic, that completely asymptomaticand [pre-symptomatic]( people do infect others and that the global fatality rate is much lower than previously thought (IFR=[0.12%]( to [0.36%]( The Denmark study showed the under-70 IFR is [0.08%]( and the Italy under-60 IFR is [at 0.05%.]( The newly revised Santa Clara/Stanford study shows all-age IFR is [0.17%](  Unlike the first estimate of a 3.4% fatality rate back in February, we no longer need to rely on early partial data from a single city. We now have many different experiments done by different teams of scientists, using different populations around the world and different methodologies. While science is not done by consensus, the results of the over 40 separate studies we have as of yesterday, indicate a median IFR of 0.2%. I don\'t think we can call this definitive yet but it does significantly narrow the possible range of IFR toward the lower end. Two months ago we feared the fatality rate was 3.4%. Even four weeks ago there were a lot of people who still feared IFR might be as much as 1%. Today, we can be increasingly confident that IFR is almost certainly under 0.5% (an upper-bound set by NY, one of the hardest hit), and likely between \\~0.1% and \\~0.3% with the vast majority of fatalities focused on 70+ year-olds already in failing health, which is where we should focus all our efforts and resources instead of massive [lockdowns of everyone.](  These scientific breakthroughs also show that CV19 is not nearly as deadly as we thought. Tens of millions of people have already been infected, never even felt sick and are now immune, probably for three to five years.These discoveries led [Tom Jefferson, an epidemiologist]( with the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford to say  &gt;“There can be little doubt that covid-19 may be far more widely distributed than some may believe... and is unlikely at this point to slow or halt viral circulation as the genie is out of the bottle.  Scientists around the world have succeeded in bringing us the knowledge needed to save more lives and beat CV19 faster. Recent antibody tests show that 25% of NYC is already infected. The unprecedented worldwide lockdown was a heroic effort but has barely slowed our enemy\'s advance. It\'s time to change tactics from trying to hide from CV19 and instead commit to directly shielding the elderly and at-risk from death as [Sweden is successfully doing ]( this [new study supports.](  The only questions that remain are whether the public will have the wisdom to understand that the science has changed and if our leaders will find the courage to act on it.  We need to ask ourselves, what is the purpose of continuing lockdowns now? They already did their job by preventing hospitals being overwhelmed. In fact, except in NYC for a few days, nowhere in the U.S. even got close. Now that the surge has passed, there is no further benefit in continuing lockdowns. Remember, lockdowns don\'t ""save"" anyone. They\'re merely a temporary ""Pause"" button. Delaying isn\'t ""saving"" anyone, it\'s just building a bigger backlog of postponed infections while slowing our progress toward the immunity that *will*save lives.  &amp;#x200B;  1/2'}, {'score_comment': 1, 'created_utc_comment': 1588622233, 'body': ""Elon musk is just shaking of people who don't follow his technology more than his social media to take pressure off of himself.

For orbit they need Super Heavy, which they haven't yet started constructing. However, Musk just tweeted that there will soon a taller VAB to assemble it in, so construction could start fairly soon. Super Heavy has a lot in common with Starship, and they need to get those common elements figured out first - mainly the pressure vessels. They are getting close to that. I believe that once Starship is up to making hops, Super Heavy will proceed apace. Apart from the thrust dome and more engines, there's not much extra to it. Raptor production has been slow, but that's partly because there's been no urgent demand for them. Musk has expressed confidence they can ramp up to making a Raptor a day soon.   So it's not implausible that once work starts, Super Heavy will take 3-6 months. Meanwhile Starship will continue with higher hops, and start practising the landing. This continues at the fast pace we have seen, with a new test article every few weeks. So when Super Heavy is ready, Starship can be ready too.  They have a big incentive to get the point where they can make orbit reliably, because then they can use it to launch Starlink. If each launch deploys 180 satellites, that does the job of three Falcon 9 launches, which saves roughly $80M in money and 6 weeks in time. Also note they've been given $135M from NASA for Starship research, which will likely cover the bills for this period. So they have both the resources and the incentive to go fast on this.   As ever, remember that the factory is the main thing here. The rockets we see are by-products of testing the rocket factory.

Hate it: Moving to the right at the end of an on-ramp to stay centered, phantom breaking, jerking 'out' of AP when it does something weird, choosing not to change lanes, or cancelling a lane change for bad reasons, bouncing in the lane.  we just went on a 2 hr drive and she openly questioned why i use autosteer 'since its so bad'.  On the value of purchase: i've already given Tesla $55k for a car they now sell for $46k.  I've already given Tesla $5k for a thing with 'value' of $7k.  If I gave Tesla $3k at original purchase, $2k during the sale or $4k last week, I don't see what I would have received.

As Elon implied in his recent tweet, this facility will be for employees for some much needed R&amp;amp;amp;amp;R and eventually might be open to the public. So, in terms of employee comfort and Elon’s implication that it will be “lots of fun”, what ideas do you have for how the resort can be fun, relaxing, and a place suited for an actual spaceport?   My ideas:   - Obviously expanding the observation deck at the restaurant. Possibly adding in outdoor screens to display telemetry and camera views.  - A Retro-Futuristic 50’s diner. - A bar called “Mars Bar”  - SpaceX store with their premium products and items only available in Boca Chica.  - A drive in movie theatre. This way you don’t need to do more to the natural environment and you can double it as a place for camera views of launches. Could allow new feature films out in theatres so employees don’t have to drive to Brownsville. Also could have an ice cream place. - Small pier/boardwalk. Don’t want to harm the natural ecosystem more, but it’d be a place to walk out to the beach directly from Highway 4.  - Good, comfortable, scenic, and quiet housing with outdoor decks. This area would also be a place to escape from the public’s eye, so privacy is key.  - Gym and Basketball court. - Small medical center. - Barber/Salon. - Facility for resident services  - Supercharges (can’t wait to see Semis and Cybertrucks at Boca Chica. That’ll go a long way to making it feel futuristic.)  - Solar Power Facility - Post Office - Simulated Martian Habitat so you could have a place to get acquainted with where you’re going and have some safe, simulated fun on Earth if you don’t feel like going to Mars but still work at the port.  - SpaceX Museum with early parts, Merlin and Raptor engines, spacesuits, concept drawings, etc. on display. Could have a planetarium too.  - Starship and Superheavy storage facility. Could have it attached to museum to show off real fleet of starships so you’d have an exhibit that’s always in motion and changing. You’re gonna need somewhere to store ships while not in use so... - Maybe an indoor observation deck as well? - Show off the nature reserve. Boca Chica should remain beautiful as it is now as much as possible.  - Eventually will need a place for guests and their needs as well as prep area for flights (maybe).   BUT, this all sounds like a small city. This list includes  basic things needed for living.

Once the bag fills, disconnect it from the hydroponics system like a plump fruit and reattach a new one, already seeded with its own sample of cyanobacteria. Then you just toss the whole bag into a chemical solution where it gets broken down into more substrates for polymers. Both the bacteria and the bag, too, since they\'re made of the same stuff. A continuously renewable loop.  You could even use transgenic cyanobacteria that overproduce the particular compounds you want, and have different strains for different polymers, or produce biofuel, or just bake it in a coke oven and compress the leftover graphite into bricks and build a 200 billion metric ton pyramid from them. Which is about as much you would actually have to produce to meaningfully displace the amount anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

The answer seems to be no and the answer is fairly obvious as to why.  Customers don't care as much about the hypothetical cost per weight as much as they care about whether the rocket is capable of taking the payload to the orbit needed and what the total cost of the launch is including insurance cost. Cost per weight is just a proxy. This is what is truly important because that is what is responsible for the lower price tag. I don't care if a hypothetical smaller expendable rocket can do it for cheaper if that rocket isn't being produced. As a consumer, I'll rather purchase an oversized rocket that limits its capacity for the sake of reuse that already has it's production line payed for. If I have a heavy enough payload, I can purchase the services of that same rocket as an expendable launch platform.

But even after millions of plane flights, there are still a lot of hardware failures - inspection, build quality and change management is not always ideal so these things happen. So the Starship safety isn’t just about how reliable things will be (which was discussed a lot), but what redundancies are available at each point (launch safety also have many threads). Which ones are deadly and which ones are recoverable. Obviously, if all of them were deadly, Starship would never be safe, even if design was perfect - any error in maintenance or build quality would result in loss of lives.   Airplanes can basically land successfully even in case when all engines fail (not at every part of the flight, though), landing gear fails, maybe even some control surfaces, though obviously not all of them. Other spaceships require that at most one of the parachutes don’t open - which if there are three or four of them, isn’t that much of a problem.   Starship is more complicated, especially while landing, so there can be problem with “wings”, engine gimbal, RCS, engine restart procedure, engine themselves and landing gear.   One engine problem should not be a deadly event, as only two are needed to land safely and software for switching landing engines is probably in the works right now. So it should be ok, at least if one engine doesn’t damage the others, but Elon said this should be non-issue.   Gimbal should also be separate for each engine, so that should be avoidable too.   Landing gear - we haven’t seen final design yet, so this would probably be total speculation   Restart procedure is also probably separate for each engine (except problem with header tanks), so it should be a non issue   any tank issue is probably fatal, but that is rare (hello, COPV); but airframe issues are also fatal on planes   control surfaces and/or RCS fail could be mitigated by software and engine gimbaling   but many of those solutions would require to start landing flip early, so if one gimbal or control surface is stuck, there would be enough time to light other engines and/or make needed adjustments.   What other failures could be mitigated, if they were to happen on landing?",32.0,27.0,"[{'score_comment': 28, 'created_utc_comment': 1614015606, 'body': ""Airplanes, even large jumbo jets, have a lot of margin of error before the plane becomes a death trap. They can have damaged wings, lose one or, for some planes, more then one engine and still attempt a safe landing. A skilled pilot can land a damaged aircraft in a river even when no runway is at hand.  In contrast, the Starship is running at the limit of functionality. Its engines are more robust then single use engines but they are not jet engines designed to take and survive a beating in bad weather. Starship's reusability means it can fly in less then perfect conditions but not by much. The margins are very small and a lot of systems have no backup, because it doesn't make sense with the starship design.  If one of the wings fall off an airplane, its pretty much doomed, but loss of landing gear, engine, fuel, and others and it can maybe survive since the plane can glide to unpowered if it retains a roughly plane shape.   Starship probably can surived a computer failure (has backup computers) and a single engine failure and thats about it. Propellant issues, landing gear issues, any control surface issues will lead to disaster. Its unlikely the starship could survive anything other then a soft landing on its landing legs. Maybe a water landing but if it tipped I don't like its chances.  To make up for this designers have put in escape systems to make rockets 'safer'. But the cost in mass for a starship escape system may be too great. But its possible SpaceX engineers find a way in the future.  Ultimately, we either accept the risk of starship for humans (after 100s of successful cargo flights) or humans will go up and down the gravity well on a seperate vehicle, like Dragon or Dreamchaser.   And thats fine for the near future, getting mass to orbit (and the moon and mars) is more important then bodies for now. And nothing is set in stone, if what is required for approval to fly the 10,000s of people to orbit that SpaceX wants is a new vehicle designed to maximum saftey then they will just work on that. Their goal is not to build the best starship possible, its to make life mulit planetary, and everything, including the crewed starship, is sacrificeable for that goal.""}, {'score_comment': 0, 'created_utc_comment': 1614016277, 'body': 'As safe as air travel has a wide range of possible interpretations.

The Raptors can't be throttled much lower and so Starship will be landing with one engine which is off center indefinitely. This means that Starship will not land perpendicular to the pad and the landing leg closest to the active engine will touch down first.  The current leg design is inelastic and so it deforms under load and can't redistribute the weight to the legs that touchdown last and it can't shift the center of mass to be above the center of the hexagon formed by the legs. It will always come to rest leaning over.  I was wondering if they could fire the RCS thrusters in the nose section at the last moment before touchdown to bring the vehicle orthogonal to the pad but this would introduce horizontal motion. Unless they also fire the opposite thrusters near the bottom and I'm not sure if this would have the authority to rotate the vehicle.  I assume that the hard landing caused a leak but if that was not the case and the vehicle started venting CH4 in its safing procedure maybe they need to wait longer until it cools off.  Edit: I just realized that several of the legs failed to lock in the down position and obviously this caused an uneven distribution of weight which probably caused serious damage to the lower section of Starship.

My own comment here: You would expect Starship to either be speeding up (if there was a loss of thrust) or slowing down (engines throttling up) until right before touchdown, if it wasn't descending at the intended speed. To me this says that either the fast landing was intentional, or that Raptor wasn't/couldn't throttle up in those last moments for some reason. Maybe engine issues? Maybe it was already at max thrust and they were overweight? Software issues? Who knows, but this is personally my biggest question going forward. * The fire we see during the descent and immediately after landing appears to be originating from a GSE hookup, not an engine. * Scott uses footage from NSF to show that the second hop was an asymmetrical failure of the LOX tank, and that the pressure from the remaining oxygen was the primary driver of the second hop. The large explosion/combustion we see afterwards is probably an effect of the pressure vessel failure and scraping metal, not the cause.

But the official video had stopped the underneath view just after the 2nd shutdown, and the external flames were then observed to be originating from the GSE region rather than an engine.  So there may have been more than one fault, or a cascade.  Landing with just one engine was also described as 'it should have enough thrust to land' the craft.  I suggest that is an open question.  It may be that something was restricting thrust and the lack of thrust was the cause (that could have been mechanical such as a fault at the time of the 2nd shutdown or related to the external fire from GSE, or a software issue).

After doing the TMI, the tankers rendezvous with and transfer prop to the Starship containing payload, and the latter does an additional burn for a faster transfer and direct entry. The tankers continue their free-return trajectory and come back to Earth, whereupon other tankers refill them enough to perform EDL (unless they can be aimed for direct entry to Earth).  This would have the benefit of allowing faster transfers/more cargo to Mars than what would be normally possible, even with full refueling. The obvious caveat is that the tankers would be out of commission until they returned back to Earth. However, there are two possibilities I'm unsure about that could sink this:  1) A free-return from Earth to Mars wouldn't return back to Earth, without some high-energy Cycler-type orbit. Meaning the tankers would be lost, making this uneconomical compared to just sending more payload-laden Starships, unless speed is required e.g. an emergency rescue mission.  2) The payload Starship using a higher-energy transfer would require leaving earlier than for a free-return trajectory, thus it couldn't do its second burn after refueling again, and have the tankers get back to Earth and the payload Starship get to the Martian surface. Which would again mean the tankers being lost.  Are either of those caveats applicable, or is there another pitfall I didn't consider?

Each launch needs a booster, which is like three Starships worth of propellant. So that is crapton (63 Starships worth) of methane for one measly cargo delivery. Logistical and financial nightmare...  I get the feeling you are confusing latency and throughput. If you want to improve throughput, you do not send tankers, you send cargo instead. Three cargo deliveries that are a little bit slower is better than one cargo delivery that is faster.  Anyway say we have infinite supply of propellant and want to overoptimize. I previously proposed [this]( You could do similar to what you propose with Moon. Send a fleet of Starships to free return trajectory of the Moon to build velocity.

Starship is limited by entry speed at Mars. We don't know what the upper limit is but a fast transfer means additional heating and g load when aerobraking.   Tanker Starship will be designed for use around Earth, and would need substantial changes (zero boil off header tanks, solar upgrades, deep space communications etc) for your mission. Better then to just build cargo ships.   You can instead do most of your TMI into a highly elliptical Earth orbit, just short of escape. Refuel with tankers there, which can return to Earth immediately. Then finish the burn with the refueled ship. Entry speeds at Mars are an issue so of course. But this scenario has been proposed for missions that need more delta-v.""}, {'score_comment': 2, 'created_utc_comment': 1615221952, 'body': ""One of the main problems is just the very long time these free return trajectories take, you are looking at least 2-3 years. A free return trajectory is also incompatible with a very fast transfer, a free return with a 6 month transfer is possible, but Starship will be aiming for 5 months or less.  Starship is very likely limited in how much payload it can survive reentry and landing with. There is a double whammy to being heavier without increasing surface area for drag: the ship has a higher terminal velocity, meaning the engines need to be ignited at a higher velocity to avoid lithobraking which means more propellant is required, and the ship is heavier which also means more propellant is required to slow it down. These factors are multiplied, potentially dramatically increasing landing propellant required. In addition, because it's less effective at slowing down, the ship has to dive deeper into Mars atmosphere in order to slow down enough that it lands on Mars rather than sailing off to the asteroid belt, but this deeper dive increases the heat load and aerodynamic forces on the ship, which may cause the heat shield or control surfaces to fail: thin as the atmosphere of Mars is, it has no problems ripping a ship to shreds if that ship is going at interplanetary velocities.  In short, the Starship will be designed with a particular volume of header tank and heat shield and control surface with a max payload in mind, and there will be no exceeding that max payload without serious redesign.""}, {'score_comment': 1, 'created_utc_comment': 1615222501, 'body': 'Acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, contractions, and other phrases which expand to something larger, that I\'ve seen in this thread:  |Fewer Letters|More Letters| |-------|---------|---| |[LEO](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/lyzohs/stub/gqbva70 ""Last usage"")|Low Earth Orbit (180-2000km)| | |Law Enforcement Officer (most often mentioned during transport operations)| |[TMI](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/lyzohs/stub/gq098wi ""Last usage"")|Trans-Mars Injection maneuver|  |Jargon|Definition| |-------|---------|---| |[lithobraking](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/lyzohs/stub/gq86nu4 ""Last usage"")|""Braking"" by hitting the [ground](|  ---------------- ^(*Decronym is a community product of r/SpaceX, implemented* )[*^by ^request*](   ^(3 acronyms in this thread; )[^(the most compressed thread commented on today)](/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/lv8m9x)^( has 25 acronyms.)   ^([Thread #7338 for this sub, first seen 8th Mar 2021, 16:54])  ^[[FAQ]]( [^([Full list])]( [^[Contact]]( [^([Source code])]('}]"

For the first window I expect an excavator that will also serve as rover, hauler and lift with some interchangeable parts. The crew will likely be staying in their ship. They will need to build a pad for future landings and start on the earthworks for a settlement. An excavator is less efficient than a bulldozer, but it's a lot more flexible; that matters since we don't really know what the subsurface is going to be like.    I expect a mobile crane very early on as well, so ships can be repositioned as needed. That will let them ship very large payload items in chomper-variants without having to build a deployment mechanism into the ship. It would also let them lay ship hulls down sideways or cut them into sections for use as more permanent habs with better rad shielding (soil).    After that it depends on the details. Are they melting ice at the glacier and moving tanks of water, or are they hauling dirty ice back to a processing area? Rodwells, shafts or clear-cut mining? Is the main settlement going in as a quarry-style excavation with backfill (dozers and draglines) or are they doing individual trenches (excavators) or is it mostly hard-rock tunnels (TBMs and roadheaders)?

A neat thing about mini-excavators is they can be small enough to fit on a Starship external lift, but can still dig down about 2.5-3 meters which is a great way to look for ice under the surface by, well, looking. Digging a ramp allows investigating deeper, of course.  On Mars you'd probably have a larger battery pack, like probably at least 50 kWh (charging by plugging into large deployed solar arrays, possibly roll out solar blankets before humans are on site). Much as with the historic solar powered rovers when the weather forecast is for reduced solar power availability you keep the battery at near full charge and run electric heaters as required. An option for staying at warm at night would actually be working at night, heat loss is not that fast due to the very thin atmosphere and quite easily mitigated by insulation and it wouldn't be too hard to have a comfortable equilibrium between the waste heat from the electrics and the heat loss: one of the harder things would actually be to do bursts of intense work without overheating, so probably they would be designed to work at a slow and steady pace.  One of the important things would be developing the autonomy software, which also has to function on a rad-tolerant computing platform. At least before humans are on site to teleoperate, the excavator has to be able to perform tasks like digging a hole without constant human babysitting (and even if humans are on site, I think autonomy would be valuable so the humans merely have to direct and troubleshoot). I don't think this would be particularly hard considering the state of the art in relevant fields.""}]"

Hell, it wouldn\'t even be the [second time]( they\'ve seriously looked at it.   C) Obviously Starship has its own problems. But that\'s not to say that the others *don\'t* have very serious issues. According to the official [source selection statement]( NASA thinks that SpaceX has the best management procedures, ranking it as ""Outstanding"" compared to ""Very Good"" for National Team and Dynetics (for an explanation of what each rank is, see Table 3, for the source, see Table 4). As far as the actual spacecraft goes, Starship is tied with National Team, both having been given an ""Acceptable"" rating compared to Dynetics\' ""Marginal"" (see Table 4). Back to my original point about Starship having it\'s own problems, the statement notes that Starship\'s mission architecture is highly ambitious, requiring ""significant number of vehicle launches in rapid succession, the refurbishment and reuse of those vehicles, and numerous in-space cryogenic propellant transfer events."" However, the paper states that ""these concerns are tempered because they entail operational risks in Earth orbit that can be overcome more easily than in lunar orbit, where an unexpected event would create a much higher risk to loss of mission."" (page 11). However, the author (Kathy Leuders, NASA head of human spaceflight), concludes that the risks presented by these propellant transfers are ""far more palatable"" because they occur on the front end of the mission, in low earth orbit, rather than in lunar orbit, where Blue Origin was [planning]( to execute complex assembly maneuvers autonomously in lunar orbit, which NASA deemed far riskier. Furthermore, SpaceX also had the most onboard redundancy of any of the options, with Leuders noting that the two airlocks, extra propellant margins, and multi engine-out capability helped to ensure that a mission would be able to be completed even with the loss of major systems (page 10) Finally, Starship had the highest downmass capability (translation: ability to bring stuff down to the lunar surface) and the most capability for expansion, which NASA likes because it represents a great potential for sustainable lunar surface operations (page 10), unlike Blue Origin, which needs a new descent stage every time, and Dynetics, who\'s proposal, according to the report, ""evidences a substantial negative mass allocation"" which ""**is disconcerting** insofar as it **calls into question** the feasibility of Dynetics’ mission architecture and its **ability to successfully close its mission** as proposed."" (page 21, emphasis mine)'}]"

Hell, it wouldn\'t even be the [second time]( they\'ve seriously looked at it.   C) Obviously Starship has its own problems. But that\'s not to say that the others *don\'t* have very serious issues. According to the official [source selection statement]( NASA thinks that SpaceX has the best management procedures, ranking it as ""Outstanding"" compared to ""Very Good"" for National Team and Dynetics (for an explanation of what each rank is, see Table 3, for the source, see Table 4). As far as the actual spacecraft goes, Starship is tied with National Team, both having been given an ""Acceptable"" rating compared to Dynetics\' ""Marginal"" (see Table 4). Back to my original point about Starship having it\'s own problems, the statement notes that Starship\'s mission architecture is highly ambitious, requiring ""significant number of vehicle launches in rapid succession, the refurbishment and reuse of those vehicles, and numerous in-space cryogenic propellant transfer events."" However, the paper states that ""these concerns are tempered because they entail operational risks in Earth orbit that can be overcome more easily than in lunar orbit, where an unexpected event would create a much higher risk to loss of mission."" (page 11). However, the author (Kathy Leuders, NASA head of human spaceflight), concludes that the risks presented by these propellant transfers are ""far more palatable"" because they occur on the front end of the mission, in low earth orbit, rather than in lunar orbit, where Blue Origin was [planning]( to execute complex assembly maneuvers autonomously in lunar orbit, which NASA deemed far riskier. Furthermore, SpaceX also had the most onboard redundancy of any of the options, with Leuders noting that the two airlocks, extra propellant margins, and multi engine-out capability helped to ensure that a mission would be able to be completed even with the loss of major systems (page 10) Finally, Starship had the highest downmass capability (translation: ability to bring stuff down to the lunar surface) and the most capability for expansion, which NASA likes because it represents a great potential for sustainable lunar surface operations (page 10), unlike Blue Origin, which needs a new descent stage every time, and Dynetics, who\'s proposal, according to the report, ""evidences a substantial negative mass allocation"" which ""**is disconcerting** insofar as it **calls into question** the feasibility of Dynetics’ mission architecture and its **ability to successfully close its mission** as proposed."" (page 21, emphasis mine)'}]"

I’ve just been busy the last couple days. But for anyone who comes across this later, here goes:  This Apollo monument is at Space View Park in Titusville. It’s a pretty cool place to visit. I’ve lived here on the Space Coast four years and this was my first time there. Well, technically my second time, because I went there the day before to scope it out. Anyway, those pillars around the outside have the handprints of a bunch of astronauts from back in the day. It’s definitely worth a visit for any space fan.   A lot of folks have commented about how much planning this must have taken, and I have to be honest, there wasn’t all that much planning involved other than scoping out my spot. It did take me quite a while to decide exactly where to set the camera, but I really just went off instinct. I’ve seen a lot of launches in the few years I’ve lived here, and that’s given me a pretty good idea of how high up in the sky the rockets go from the perspective of a few miles away (15 miles in this case). It’s not always exactly the same, of course, but the crewed flights follow a somewhat similar trajectory to Starlink launches, and we’ve seen a *ton* of those. So yeah, I just made an educated guess. I knew where the launch pad was, and I knew what direction Falcon would be flying.   As soon as I saw main engine cutoff, I stopped the first exposure, and frantically changed my aperture to a setting that would gather more light, and started a second exposure. If I hadn’t done that, the white part would’ve been much dimmer.   Side note for those who don’t understand what they’re seeing: It was dark on the ground because it was still an hour before sunrise. The white part is when the rocket had risen up into sunlight, and the exhaust plume was being backlit by the sun against a dark sky. And because it was a long exposure, the light from its traverse across the sky was all imprinted on the camera sensor.   Ok, so I left that second exposure running until the second stage was out of sight. I took the two images and layered them to show both phases of flight in the same image. And there you have it! If you have any other questions about this photo, feel free to ask.   I did a re-edit once I was home on my computer, and I think it’s much better. It’s available on my website for print, or just seeing the final product. I also have a 20% discount with the promo code CREW2. No pressure to buy a print, but I would like to know what folks think about the newer edit.   '}]"

Can anyone help? Nothing gets the public more excited about going to space than watching a good live launch, especially of people. I do get to watch many Starlink launches on YouTube, usually Everyday Astronaut, but that’s not the kind of excitement that things related to exploration raises and I’m not able to spend all my days checking YouTube to see if there’s something each day.

The whole idea of using a drone ship is that it is safer in the event of a crash, if no-one is aboard. So why? Maybe it has something to do with landing Starships.  SpaceX rarely builds something that just repeats the capabilities of the old model. Never repeats, actually. Every drone ship has had improvements.

I think it's logical to assume there is either a longer use case for these vehicles with Falcon 9, or a future purpose with Deimos/Phobos.   With that in mind, it's not unreasonable to consider if all are refitted and a fourth introduced, that each platform would have two drone ships to act as support ships.

It goes hand and hand with the idea that each Starship needs to be best utilized. There really is no point in  creating a great production line if extra Starships are sitting on Mars unnecessarily for years. Those unneeded Starship could be better utilized back at earth preparing for the next trip in two years. But how do we decrease the number of Starship sitting idle on Mars? By increasing the cargo capacity of Starship.  Or one could take the logic differently and use the same amount of Starships but increase the amount of cargo to mars.  So logically, the question is: How do we increase the cargo capacity of Starship without ""significantly"" changing the architecture? The answer: Drop tanks or more specifically drop-Starships.  Similar to Apollo that propelled one propulsion unit (LM) with another propulsion unit (CSM). I propose using one fully fueled tanker to propel another fully fueled Mars/Lunar Starship. The nearly spent tanker Starship could detach and return to earth where it can be used immediately for current mars departures or preparation for the next departure. This could significantly increase to payload capacity of Starship to Mars and the Moon and potentially even remove the need for high energy elliptical earth orbit refueling for Moon missions.  Adding drop tanks radially on orbit would be very complicated. A drop tank butt to butt with a Mars/Lunar Starship wouldn't work either. A tanker Starship docked at the front of a Mars Starship (nose to nose) could help propel the Mars Starship and increase its payload from 100-150 tons\~ to 200-300 tons\~.  Edit:  Alternatively the same process could be used without changing the size of the payload to reduce the travel time. It may be possible to shave a couple months off the transit time to Mars using this process without increase the payload.  Edit Edit:  After further thought I remembered a fundamental problem with sending 300 tons to Mars. Only 150 tons can reach LEO at any one launch. My hair brain solution is to send two cargo launches to LEO. One with a full cargo bay and empty aft cargo pods. The second with empty cargo bay but with full cargo pods. Transferring cargo pods could be as simple as docking a tank Starship to refuel.

The vehicle would have to expend more fuel decelerating after stage separation, then return to Earth.  Also, the final ""stage"" Starship would have to expend much more energy slowing down in Martian atmosphere due to a much larger mass.  Add the thin atmosphere, and that really doesn\'t seem to be a benefit'}, {'score_comment': 3, 'created_utc_comment': 1628124097, 'body': 'To your edit, I don\'t think it would ""speed up"" the trip as much as it would ""allow you to leave later"".

L. Mencken*  The IDA is not designed to handle loads, and it\'s only intended to handle the torque of a small vessel docked with the ISS. This ""drop tank"" solution doesn\'t address the other end of the trip either: the cargo capacity of Starship alters the aerodynamic design and the landing propellant requirements.  If we look back to your requirements, you\'ve decided that Starships sitting idle on Mars are there unnecessarily, and that they would be better utilised back at Earth. Then your solution is to increase the cargo carried by each Starship before it sits idle on Mars.  I think in the first instance any Starships that are sent to Mars during the construction of the first propellant plant will be necessary for habitation: living space, air conditioning, power, and storage for propellant reserves. Some of them might even end up broken down for spare parts or scrap metal. Every gram of stainless steel will be useful, especially if the first wave of craft includes cutting and welding equipment. Recycling is going to be an essential part of the sustainability of a city on Mars.  Rather than doubling the cargo capacity of an individual Starship, doubling then utility of the cargo each Starship carries is worth looking at. Some Starships will be carrying about 100t of stainless steel to Mars along with all the cargo packed inside the cargo bay, others will be providing Starship-sized propellant storage tanks. They definitely aren\'t going to be ""idle"" and ""unnecessary"".'}, {'score_comment': 9, 'created_utc_comment': 1628124439, 'body': '&gt; It goes hand and hand with the idea that each Starship needs to be best utilized.

It\'s a physics problem. More cargo is more kinetic energy you need to scrub off at Mars. The ship is denser, and the weight balance is changed. You also need more landing fuel, which means larger header / low boiloff tanks, and thus more weight again.   Cargo Starship is not really delta-v restricted for most transfer windows, presuming you go with a efficient but 6+ month transfer. With a full load of fuel, a cargo ship could reasonable leave LEO for Mars with up to 300 tons of cargo without any extra boost needed. Could it land 300 tons of cargo? We don\'t know, but I suspect not without major improvements and changes.   Your concept of a Starship tug can be done with refuelling, and has been discussed here quite a lot and mentioned by Elon. Fuel up your cargo ship, and a tanker. Both burn a bit under half their fuel into a higher energy orbit. They dock, transfer fuel until the cargo ship is full. The tanker returns to Earth or LEO via a short burn and aerobraking. The cargo ship now has a full fuel load, just as if it had been pushed there by a tug. You have to \'dock\' the ships once either way. It\'s potentially slightly more efficient using two ships because you have more thrust to better take advantage of the oberth effect - but only for some missions. No changes have to be made to any of the ships.  Fast travel times are also an issue, as kinetic energy varies with velocity squared, so scrubbing off the extra speed is potentially very challenging. Again, maybe in the future as they collect more data, try aerocapture etc. We just don\'t know yet.  Having a high orbit fuel depot is one way to gain more delta-v. Solar Electric Propulsion seems like a decent prospect for a fuel tug in the significantly further future. Imagine a fleet of very scaled up Starlink satellites that constantly haul Metholox up the gravity well, and departing Starships stop in to get topped off.   I think optimising for the cargo to Mars (and the Moon) problem goes the other way. Build more cargo ships, and don\'t bring them back. Only bring back passenger ships. Scaling up and improving the production line is hard, but it has so many flow on benefits.  Elon has said before there is nothing on Mars that is worthwhile economically to bring back to Earth. That includes once used cargo Starships. You bring back (some) people, and scientific samples, because they are somewhat outside the scope of the economics. The only other reason to bring back cargo Starships is if you have a production bottleneck on Earth, and your supply is limited. So you effectively ""buy"" cargo ships by returning them from Mars - the cost being building, maintaining and running a multi megawatt Mars fuel production factory and rocket launch complex.   What\'s likely to be cheaper / easier / faster? Improving mass production on Earth, or improving fuel production and launch capabilities on Mars? I\'d bet on Earth.'}]"

Booster + Dragon launched vertical = 240km altitude, 5.5 minutes of time in freefall. $160k propellant cost.**  (There was a [Starship version of this question]( where I did similar calcs last year. Much more viable perhaps.)  Let's do a New Shepard style flight with Falcon 9. But IMO more fun to leave the capsule attached to the booster the entire time. That sonic boom during landing would be great! Perhaps less safe but then you do still have Super Draco abort. Parachuting down would be interesting, but then you need to recover and stack the capsule again. Dragon propulsive landing would be even more fun!   * Assume a Dragon or similar capsule, mounted directly to the Falcon 9 first stage.   * 25 tons Booster dry mass.  * Assume 293 average engine ISP  * Assume 10 tons Capsule + people / interstage / trunk / extra cuploa / barf bags etc weight.   * Assume 5 tons propellant leftover.  * Total dry mass = 40 tons. Propellant = 395 tons. DV = ~6700 m/s  Our booster + Dragon has about 6,700 m/s dv, but let's work from 6000 to give some wiggle room for various extra losses or need to throttle back at certain times.   Let's assume we launch vertical at an average of 2G as felt by the passengers. Launch TWR is 1.75, so it will be slightly under 2G at launch, and slightly over 2G at engine cut off. We burn a bit under half our propellant, then coast up, then fall back vertically. The booster ignites engines and does a fully powered entry and landing - the reverse of take off. The forces felt up and down are the pretty much the same, and gentler on the booster than a normal flight.   The launch burn lasts around 153 seconds and engine cut-off is at 115 km altitude. The rocket is then doing about 1500 m/s vertically, and coasts for another 166 seconds, and 125km, for a total height of 240 km. Spin the whole thing to point at the Earth while coasting, and open up the cover on the Cupola for best views.   Then the reverse occurs for landing - fall back to 115km altitude, ignite engines, and decelerate at an average of 2g as felt by the passengers. Total flight time is about 10.5 minutes. Around 5.5 minutes of that is in freefall, for shenanigans.   How much would it cost? Hard to know. The booster is not very stressed by this flight, so refurb might be minimal. Propellant is supposedly about $200k for Falcon 9, but the booster uses about $160k of that.   Propellant cost + operational cost + refurb cost... Assuming 7 passengers in Dragon, then propellant alone is $22k. ~~$100k per passenger seems doable.~~ On further consideration, $100k each ($700k total) is unlikely without huge optimisations and possibly changes. Key unknown to me (more info a reply below) is exact refurb needed for engine coking.   Maybe you could squeeze extra passengers in since Dragon can take loads of cargo. Some systems could be removed too. 10 people? Or should you take 5 and charge twice as much? Launch forces are low, so maybe you can have a huge cupola with a fold back cover. Charge two people extra to view from there?  **Other options -**  * Partially fuel up the Falcon 9 Booster. 130 tons of fuel ($50k cost) is enough delta-v to just get you over 100km altitude. But where is the fun in that?  * 2G (as felt by the passengers) is an easy ride. The thrill seekers version could do 3g or 4g. At 4g your gravity losses are much reduced. Engine cut-off is 86km and you coast to a massive 366km altitude. And you get a bit over 8 minutes of zero-g!   * Weight reduction / lower margins means longer zero-g time. These numbers are perhaps quite conservative.   * Aerobraking during re-entry. Instead of burning all the way down, we can shed some velocity by 'flying', as the booster does normally. That leaves extra propellant for the up part of the journey, so extra zero-g time and altitude.   * [Use Starship instead.]( More room to move, more passengers, lower costs. Cons, it is not finished yet ;)  * What if we put a giant Dragon on Super Heavy? Or launch the full Starship stack vertically (1000km altitude!)? Or don't launch as high, and use spare fuel to hover at the highest altitude? Or drop at varying levels of thrust to simulate different planet's gravities?

However, in general, anything brought back on a mission is property of the person who picked it up, however that would by contract probably go to their mission agency.  IE NASA astronaut signs a contract that anything they bring back belongs to NASA, SpaceX astronaut signs a contract that anything they bring back belongs to SpaceX.    SpaceX might not require such a contract though (or might not enforce it as heavily as NASA).  NASA has always had a very 'controlled' culture- mission planners know EVERYTHING that goes up and comes down.  Cost was a major factor of that- during Apollo a single KG to the moon or back cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Each moon rock was worth millions.  So if the astronauts came back with a few extra KG of 'souvenirs', that's basically NASA paying $millions for a few astronauts to get desk ornaments, which wasn't seen as a good use of resources.    SpaceX will likely be different though.  Much lower cost per KG there and back.  And much more likely to be easily repeated, especially if the same ship can be used multiple times.  SpaceX could, theoretically, do a Starship-to-Moon-and-back mission, and fly it 3 or 4 times a year.  For something like that, they'd probably start taking tourists and let them carry whatever they wanted back.""}]"

Yet everyone takes for granted the oxygen that we breathe, the pure H2O that falls from the skies, and the food that grows on trees.  Effectively preserving this amazing planet for thousands of generations into the future is not the top priority of the general public.         Strangely enough, public perception of the importance and beauty of this planet was largely triggered by a single photograph taken in 1968 by Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders while in orbit around the Moon and a Christmas wish for “peace for all of you on the good planet Earth.”         In the future, should Starship enable sustained manned research stations on the Moon and Mars, the formidable ISRU challenges of producing sufficient quantities of food, water, and air (as well as radiation protection!) for teams of geologists, astronomers, doctors, and engineers should help further drive home the enormous value and vital importance of this amazing planet that we are all so dependent upon.         And if we are to come up with effective solutions to keep Planet Earth healthy and happy for so many years into the future we will need a great deal of scientific/engineering talent, drive, and imagination.  We may need to confront formidable challenges, beyond current CO2 production rates, such as antibiotic-resistant pathogens, pandemics, solar flares, supervolcanoes, magnetic field reversals, asteroid impacts, and the slowly increasing brightness of the Sun.         And as Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson has pointed out, a visibly active space exploration program is the most effective driver of student interest and enthusiasm for STEM. So many American innovators over the past decades can point to the Apollo moon landings as what inspired them to become engineers rather than lawyers or accountants. Who wouldn’t love to have their name attached to the discovery of life on Europa, or other exciting possibilities?         Finally, I would like to point out a more down-to-earth environmental benefit of the Starship development program.  Because Starship will be rapidly reusable with a minimum requirement for maintenance resources, it will be a much less environmentally-demanding way to put vital communications, earth observation, military, and scientific payloads into space.  The manufacturing and operation of a single starship will require a much smaller human “footprint” than the vast army of engineers and technicians required to manufacture and operate the hundreds of expendable launch vehicles that one starship will replace.  Instead, we may be able to redirect these talents and resources towards more vital and productive objectives.         In closing, I would like to observe that just as the environmental movement was triggered by NASA’s Apollo program, Starship will open up an exciting new field of space resource management for surface operations on the Moon, Mars, dwarf planets such as Ceres, planetary moons, such as Europa, and asteroids such as Vesta.  Planetary protection measures for Mars and Europa should be particularly interesting and exciting.

I have been following SpaceX's Boca Chica activities and development for a couple of years. I also visited the site in-person and inspected the areas surrounding their facility in June of 2020. After reading the Draft Programmatic Environmental Assessment recently released by the FAA, I want to offer the following comments and opinions.   First and foremost, I believe the importance of this project cannot be overstated. SpaceX's plans to develop the Superheavy Booster and Starship are vital to our nation's continued leadership in space exploration as well as national security and commercial interests. For this reason, it is my opinion that SpaceX should be granted wide latitude to develop and operate their Superheavy and Starship program.   I believe the FAA should grant a waiver so that SpaceX does not need to mitigate the following environmental impact categories: Visual Effects, Cultural Resources, Department of Transportation Act, Section 4(f) and Land Use. With respect to Biological Resources, SpaceX should implement all suggested mitigation activities except the contracting of a qualified biologist during both construction and operation, for which SpaceX should also be granted a waiver. With respect to all other environmental impact categories, SpaceX should be required to implement the proposed mitigation activities as outlined in the report.   I humbly urge the FAA to promptly approve SpaceX's permit for construction and operation of their facility and vehicles with the measures implemented as outlined above. Thank you for your time and consideration.""}, {'score_comment': 1, 'created_utc_comment': 1633245250, 'body': ""Is this just for Americans.

The fact that Tesla can give people per-trip feedback on several of these metrics effortlessly, for free, in near-real time is frankly astounding and as usual, absolutely shames the rest of the industry.  All that said, nothing is perfect and my wife mentioned she hesitated to brake hard for a crossing deer because she was worried about not getting into the beta. Not thrilled with that concept, and a good reinforcement of why no one should want their premiums based on this data.

Have reported this to Tesla 3 times.  Have even scheduled service to get it checked.  I\'m green on EVERYTHING but Forward Collision Warnings are KILLING me.  And no, I\'m not a worse driver than I think I am. Hear me out.  Something is seriously wrong.  For the first couple weeks I\'d get home after a VERY uneventful ""granny"" level drive, check my score and nearly drop my phone because of the FCW dings when NO FCW alerts sounded in the vehicle.  Then I read the detail about the scoring system which said that it measures FCW based on the ""medium"" setting, regardless of how your profile is set.  I checked mine and remembered I had set it to ""late"" a year or so ago because it was dinging so often.  Again, NOT because I am following too closely.  I generally keep 2 to 3 car lengths minimum, and have a pretty simple 5 mile surface street daily commute.  Here are some of the situations which caused me to change my FCW setting which before the driving score was just to quiet the frequent nuisance alerts, but which I now realize is a symptom of a bigger problem for my vehicle and which is KILLING my score.  **Example 1:** Someone merges OUT of the lane in front of me, FULLY INTO the turning lane.  If I\'m on autopilot, it slows down almost to a stop before passing them, usually to the point where I have to disengage autopilot to avoid unsafely slowing or even stopping in a wide open lane, and potentially getting rear ended.  These events also apparently trigger a FCW. And this even happens occasionally when coming up a hill on a right hand turn and someone is in the turning lane to the left of my wide open lane.  No danger at all, but Ding anyway.  **Example 2:**  Someone in front of me turns right, OUT of the lane, onto a side street or into a parking lot, again, if I\'m in autopilot, the car slows down almost to a stop before passing that vehicle which has FULLY exited my lane.  Generally I have to disengage AP.  And also, of course, it throws a FCW.  I mean, what the heck?  **Example 3:**  This happened just yesterday.  Going about 35, clear day, white car 2-3 car lengths in front of me. Red truck about 1 car length in front of that white car.  Red truck slows down abruptly.  My car impressively detects that slowdown, and presto...FCW.  Which...thanks, I guess?  But in actuality there was NO real risk.  We weren\'t going fast.  I had PLENTY of time. Didn\'t even have to tap the breaks. Just lifted off and let regen slow me down.  Didn\'t even interrupt the flow of traffic.  That\'s just called ""Traffic"".  But I still got dinged anyway.  Situations like that are WHY I set my FCW to ""late"" some time ago.  I was just tired being startled by an alert in instances where it was not relevant and there was NO real threat.  So now I\'m realizing something is apparently wrong, at least with my car.  I will go so far as to say there is basically NO way for anyone to drive MY vehicle in REGULAR daily city driving, and achieve any score close to 100.  Even if I leave 4 car lengths, someone will swerve in front of me to take that space, and I\'ll get dinged.  Huge Tesla fan, but really frustrated with the way this score thing is going for me.

So little that I slammed on the accelerator otherwise I worry it would have forced them to slam on the brakes. This is something I know I\'ll need to keep an eye out for going forward.    * Couple turning mistakes - once it got into the ""straight lane"" when it was intending to turn left.

I drove in my local area to nearby grocery stores and McDonald\'s. Here\'s my observations:  * Darkness and early morning sunlight did not make a significant difference in my drive. * It handles neighborhood local driving very well. Turns a bit more quickly than I\'m used to, but it was safe and mostly smooth. I think FSD excels at slower speeds. * It handled a traffic circle like a champ, too. That impressed me, I was scared that might pose an issue. * Once it gets on faster roads, its turning speed is *really* aggressive for me, and I had to intervene a few times because I got nervous. Once, when making a protected left, I took control when it looked like it was about to turn into a car waiting at the stoplight. I think it would have made it, but it was way closer than I normally am comfortable with. * Lane changes are much smoother than with normal Autopilot. I really like this, I think this will make NoAP on the highway way less nerve wracking for me. * So is going through traffic lights. I had already gotten used to having to tap the accelerator or stalk to go on green, but now it\'s not necessary and it works great. * It can\'t handle complicated parking lots almost at all. This is where I had to intervene a lot, because even on driving lanes it was so ""jittery"" with pedestrians coming and going and cars stopping and starting. I\'m definitely going to be manual on parking lots for the time being. (It also confirms an observation I made long ago, that parking lots may be the most dangerous parts of the road, more than highways and local streets.)  Some tips that may help:  * If you have speed limit offset, turn it back to +0. Raise it only when traffic is a lot faster. This helps with the aggressive turns. * Don\'t get distracted too much by the new visualizations--they\'re really cool but in this beta you really want to keep your eyes on the road. This is where the eye tracker camera should be robust. * Those of us who got it now had 100 safety scores, and are probably careful drivers by nature. FSD is going to seem a lot more ""careless"" than you might be used to. Don\'t be too afraid to intervene but it\'s important to trust the system just a little bit. It does work in the main.  Overall, I am very impressed. There are obvious limitations, but I\'m confident they will be overcome in due time, and I\'m going to try a longer/commute-length driver on the highway later this week.

The second correction was some confusion over two lanes merging into one and it lost confidence on the lane markers. * It did a great job changing lanes in somewhat challenging traffic with commuters. * For some reason it every so often slowed down without any explanation with no other cars or people around. * We got passed a few times because we were going the speed limit and other cars lost their patience going 25 MPH. * At a train crossing it stopped well ahead of the painted train crossing lines on the road.

In other words, I wish more people could watch the series and be inspired about Space without needing a Netflix account.  I definitely hope Jared is planning more ambitious missions.

Miles with a 100 score is key from here on out. There also seems to be some confusion on if AP can help your score or not, so want to cover that too -  have a tl;dr 3 bullets at the end  hopefully this helps at least a few people understand the system better   There are two scores we care about ==========================   * **Daily Score:** This score is _only_ affected by the 5 safety factors. FCW, Hard Breaking, Aggressive turning, Unsafe following distance, and forced autopilot disengagement.   * **Total Score:** The score you care about most. This is the main score in the app, and the one you want high to get into the beta. This score is _only_ affected by your Daily Scores weighted by miles driven on each score.    ----------------------------    TL;DR Only way to raise your score now, is to get high daily scores (ideally 100) with a lot of miles driven at that score. **You don’t need to go trying to fix one of your overall safety factors, it wont do anything**   **What about autopilot**  ================  AP imo is the best thing possible to help raise your “Total Score”, lets explain how it actually works for each score type.   **Autopilot and the Daily Score**  ===============  As stated above, the only thing that matters for your daily score are each of the safety factors. While on AP, Anything it does bad will not hurt any of those factors. AP can hard brake, it can get FCW off a hill, and your score will not be hurt… However, it's also not increasing the daily score, which can make things tricky - here is an example:  - Lets say you only have a single turn, and one light before you get to the highway and turn on AP.  However, the only time you used your brakes while _you_ were driving, you got dinged for hard braking, then you are going to have near max hard braking score affecting you ( because 100% of the braking you did, was hard braking) , as AP will not lower that / count in the calculations for braking.  You could end up with a super low score, and a lot of miles added to that weight, yikes  However, if you were able to get to the highway with a 100, Activate that AP! You want those miles for your Total score, and youll no longer be dinged for someone cutting you off.   -----------------------------  TL;DR - AP will not raise or lower your daily score. Make sure if you are using AP, that your score for the day was high before turning it on. You dont want to add a lot of miles to a low score. If your score is low, stop using AP for that day. You need to manually drive to improve your safety factors (aka your daily score)   **Autopilot and your Total Score** ===============================  Yes, all miles driven on AP get calculated into the weighted score. So driving long trips on AP are ideal for raising your total score (as long as the daily score for that day is high). A quote from tesla’s safety score website:  &gt;Your daily Safety Score is not impacted by the number of miles or hours you drive. We combine your daily Safety Scores (up to 30 days) into a **mileage-weighted average** to calculate the aggregated Safety Score, which is displayed on the main ‘Safety Score’ screen of the Tesla app.   ----------------------  TL;DR AP good if your daily score is good. Turn off AP if you need to raise your daily score.   **If you have a bad score, make sure to do what you need to fix it _THAT_ day** ==================   Once the day is over, that score is your score. If you get a 10% on hard braking on day A, it is to late to go and try to brake a lot on day B, that will do nothing for your total score. At that point, you can only lower the weight of that bad score by getting a lot of miles on better daily scores   **Best way to improve Hard braking**    Your hard brake score is based of the % of time you are braking, without braking to hard. AP does not help with this (AP will also not hurt this is it hard brakes)  As long as it is the same day as the hard brake. Go somewhere safe, where you can get a little speed, then let regenerative braking brake for you. Never use your brake pedal itself, Also dont fully let your foot of the accelerator. Look at the graphic of your car on the screen, the lights on the brakes will light up once you are slowing down fast enough for the car to consider it “braking”.        **Best way to improve unsafe following**   This is another one where it calculates it off a % of the time you are close enough to another car, without being to close.. The trick here is, you need to be going over 50 mph, and being on AP will not help you.  You will need to hit the highway and find another car you can get a safe distance from **(there has to be a car in front of you)** and go over 50 mph.  Once again, this is for the daily score. No point in doing this if you have a perfect follow score for the day  ----------------------------------   * You can read about the calculations here:   * public spreadsheet i found on this reddit that I use (not mine):    * Tool version of the sheet above:    ----------------------------   **Ultimate tl;dr**  * Dont bother trying to fix overall safety factor such as “hard braking“ for your **total score**. it has no impact on your total score  * You want 100's with lots of miles -&gt; us AP to get those miles  * If your **DAILY score** for the day is low, turn off AP, you need to drive by hand to get that score up / fix safety factors.""}, {'score_comment': 1, 'created_utc_comment': 1634288278, 'body': 'At 97 on the verge of 98.

The worst part however is the fact that you have to completely change your eyes’ focus  to look at the “screen”. Your focal distance when driving is a at minimum a car ahead, and when switching to something that’s at arms length, your eyes take a split second to adjust. This isn’t an issue with regular mirrors as you are focusing on an optical reflection of a roughly the same distance as looking forward.   Another issue is that you can’t peek to the side to see more or check a blind spot. The wide angle of the camera partially makes up for that, but it’s an entire new habit to learn.

It may do the wrong thing at the worst time, so you must always keep your hands on the wheel and pay extra attention to the road. Do not become complacent. When Full Self-Driving Beta is enabled, your vehicle will make lane changes off highway, select forks to follow your navigation route, navigate around other vehicles and objects, and make left and right turns. Use Full Self-Driving Beta only if you will pay constant attention to the road, and be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations. Every driver is responsible for remaining alert and active when using Autopilot and must be prepared to take action at any time.         As part of receiving FSD Beta, your vehicle will collect and share VIN-associated vehicle driving data with Tesla to confirm your continued eligibility for FSD Beta feature.

How to provide feedback:        Press the ""Video Record"" button on the top bar UI to share your feedback. When pressed, your vehicle’s external cameras will share a short VIN-associated Autopilot Snapshot with the Tesla engineering team to help make improvements to FSD. You will not be able to view the clip.    You can email your feedback to fsdbeta@tesla.com. In your email please include date, time, location, and if you took an Autopilot Snapshot.

He will indeed pay income tax when realising stock options, but one of the major problems with the US tax system is that once he\'s got them Musk can make money that is functional income - as in money that lands in his bank account for him to spend - without ever having to sell those shares and suffer capital gains tax OR class it as interest or dividends or a salary and pay income tax. Here\'s how it works: On November 1st 2016, Tesla was worth $27.5b at $37.88 a share. Musk owns roughly 25% of Tesla, which makes the value of his stake $9.47 billion. Let\'s say he wants $100million per year in spending money; banks will issue loans to a value of about 67% the collateral value, so he puts up about $1.5bil in shares as collateral on a $1bil loan (15.8% of his stake). Now interest rates for this kind of thing are dirt, dirt cheap; single figures cheap. Let\'s top that out and call it 9% interest, over a 5 year term. That\'s $90m * 5 = $450mil in interest, which he pays off with the loan money, leaving $110 million per year of doing billionaire-stuff money for him to blow, tax free, on whatever the hell he wants. 5 years later, it\'s November 1st 2021. Tesla is now worth $1.1trillion. That 25% stake Musk owns is worth $275billion. His loan is due, so what does he do? He could sell a preposterously small percentage of his stake, pay the taxes, and then pay off the loan. But he doesn\'t do that, instead he goes to bank B and takes out another loan. This time he wants more doing-billionaire-stuff money, and he has to pay off his original $1billion loan. He takes out a loan for $4billion dollars, which requires nearly $6billion in collateral; this time that\'s just over 2% of his stake instead of nearly 16%. He will need to pay $1.8 billion in interest on top of his original $1 billion loan, so that leaves $4b - $2.8b = $1.2 billion of doing-billionaire-stuff money; $240 million a year. At the ridiculously low income tax rates we have today, Musk in the above scenario should have paid over $200million in income taxes during that first 5 year period, instead he can pay absolutely nothing. Not a single cent. All the while living the kind of lifestyle only a $110 million annual expenditure can buy you, and start the next 5 year period on twice that money having risked a fifth of what he originally did. This is why the ""But It\'s Not Actual Money In His Account"" defense is so ridiculous; billionaires use their capital to access colossal amounts of cash without having to sell their stakes; as long as their stocks appreciate at a rate more than twice that of the stupid low interest on their loans, they\'re laughing all the way to their bank. The end game of all of this of course is that you die, and your heirs inherit both your assets and your liabilities. But here\'s the goofy thing; when they sell your stock, your heirs pay capital gains tax on the increase in value from the point they inherited them, not from whenever you originally got them. So if you die at the end of that second 5 year period with an outstanding $4 billion loan, your heirs simply sell $4 billion of inherited stock for $0 tax and pay off your debt - then go take out their own loan. Obviously I\'m making these numbers up. For example, my 9% interest rate figure is total bogus, in fact this kind of thing costs them around 0.85%. Similarly the paltry $6bil of collateral I\'m using an example above is far wide of the mark; the actual value of Musk\'s shares tied up as loan collateral is $112 billion (92million shares at todays price of $1223). I\'ll let you do the math on that.  Comment credit: tree_bom'}, {'score_comment': 2, 'created_utc_comment': 1636280116, 'body': ""If he tanks the price, I'm buying.

He also addressed one questioner's concern about forward contamination (Earth-to-Luna, Earth-to-Mars) by saying that Mars is a big place and human presence would be concentrated at bases that are microscopic in area compared to the entire surface of Mars.   The heat shield tiles and the leeward side stainless steel will experience high temperatures during the Mars EDL. That environment will probably do a good job of destroying any biological material on the Ship's hull.   And contamination from the interior of Ship will be contained inside by a combination airlock and associated decontamination chamber built into the payload bay. And any Mars contamination will be prevented from entering the interior of Ship.   The skirt part of the hull containing the engines probably will be sterilized during the trans mars injection (TMI) burn and during the landing burn. The three Rvac nozzles will be white hot (2400F (1316C)) for up to 5 minutes during each burn. The thermal radiation from the nozzles will heat the interior of the skirt to sterilization temperatures in excess of 1000F (538C).""}, {'score_comment': 6, 'created_utc_comment': 1637288755, 'body': 'Found another source video  '}, {'score_comment': 3, 'created_utc_comment': 1637299981, 'body': 'Honestly, when I saw this video being streamed, I was about 50% torn on whether it was yet another cryptocurrency scammer.

Musk’s estimate for his 2021 taxes is in line with expectations from agencies such as CNBC, which noted that the CEO had already paid $7 billion in state and federal taxes this year, with about $5 billion more expected to be paid by January 1, 2022.

Solar users need to pay their fair share, or else the whole grid will collapse. This is the same problem as with roads - EV users act as freeloaders when roads are paid for by gas taxes.  The solution, however, is not charging solar users based on the size of the system. The solution is one flat fee for everyone connected to the grid — one fee that truly pays for ensuring 100% uptime for the grid — and then one separate fee for KWh used. This would, most likely, result in solar users having their monthly bill go up, but that’s an unfortunate reality.

For non-solar users, that availability and maintaining it is part of the power price.  I can see that charging a price for having the power on tap when you are not normally consuming much is worth something - sort of an insurance.

The first 5 months of service essentially pay back the loss on Dishy manufacturing.   Essentially 2.5 million users is the break even for 12,000 satellite network. 2.5 million users is about 250 million a month in revenue. To maintain about 12,000 satellites with 5 year use life is 2400 satellites per year or 200 per month so 4 F9 launches. Reports are that the satellites run about 500k each for the v2 laser ones. So 100 million per month for satellites and another 100 mil for launch costs at 25 mil per rocket launch and 50 sats in each, is 200 million. Then dish manufacturing, if we assume loss of 500 per dish and 50k dishs per month that would cover 600k dishes per year (new customers or replacement) at 25 million in cost over dish sale revenue. This works if you assume a user will keep service or dish lasts 4 years on average. That leaves 25 mil in net revenue per month after they recoup dish losses, most of which will be needed to cover operations cost.   I saw a report that indicates that 12k sats with an assumption of 20-25 GB/s throughput per satellite (currently about what they have, but I think it's improving and they were said to be targeting 50 GB/s on the newest sats) would give them the ability to handle 1.5-2ish million users in the US alone with a standard oversubscription rate of 3-4x. I don't know exactly what that translates to world wide, but you have to assume it's over 10 million users.

So, it guarantees that Crew Dragon can dock with HLS or a variant of Starship.  2/ SpaceX give a try for CLD in which they want to use a variant of HLS as an LEO space station. So, it it posible that they have some plan to build an HLS variant to test their life support equipment.  3/ The point of Polaris is to demonstrate new technology. A new (maybe temporary) commercial space station consists of entirely commercial crew is well suit for this mission.  4/ Polaris Dawn (1st mission) is NET Q4 2022, and then Polaris 2nd mission can happen in late 2023. It will allow SpaceX to launch Starship 10-15 time. Which that much launch, it will give SpaceX sufficient data about how Starship will behave in SpaceX.  Bonus: SpaceX does not seem to working on life support system for HLS. But, with 100-150 tons to LEO, they can just use a big life support system that might weight up to 20 tons and it will be enough for Polaris 2 with four crew. Later on, they can simplify the system, just like the way they put everything in Raptor-1 then make it simpler to become Raptor-2  Edit: I just learn after making the post that Jared mentioned that Starship will involve in Polaris 2.",23.0,55.0,"[{'score_comment': 14, 'created_utc_comment': 1644973467, 'body': ""There's been no mention of it so I don't expect they'll be docking Starship and Dragon as part of any Polaris missions. However, SpaceX might stand up a Dragon to be ready as a lifeboat if there's a problem with Polaris 2.  I wouldn't be surprised if they do some cargo missions to the ISS to prove it rendezvous and docking. I expect SpaceX would want to prove rendezvous with Starship before it is used for HLS, but I think it would be less costly to dock starship for the first time with ISS or another starship than Dragon.""}, {'score_comment': 15, 'created_utc_comment': 1644984250, 'body': 'Can you clarify your edit?
